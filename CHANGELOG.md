# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security

- Lock files (`kaola-workflow/.locks/*.lock`) and session files (`kaola-workflow/.sessions/*.json`) are now created with restrictive mode `0o600` (owner read/write only) instead of the default umask.
- `kaola-workflow-claim.js` now validates `claim_comment_id` as a digit-only integer before writing to the `## Lease` block in `workflow-state.md`. Non-digit values render as `N/A`, preventing markdown corruption.
- `cmdPatchBranch` now rejects `--branch` arguments containing `\n` or `\r` characters, preventing markdown section injection into `workflow-state.md`.
- `cmdStatus` now skips (or drift-flags) lock entries whose `session_id` fails `isSafeName()` validation, preventing path traversal when reading session files.
- `updateSinkLease` now uses function-form `.replace()` callbacks instead of string-form, preventing `$&`/`$1` metacharacter expansion if workflow field values contain `$` characters.

### Changed

- `updateLeaseInPlace()` now emits a stderr warning when the `## Lease` section is missing in `workflow-state.md`, instead of silently no-oping. Message: `updateLeaseInPlace: ## Lease section missing in <path>`
- `simulate-workflow-walkthrough.js`: Epic Case 8 (tests 8A–8F) added for claim-hardening validation. Tests verify lock/session file permissions, claim_comment_id validation, unsafe session_id drift detection, branch-name injection prevention, and heartbeat warnings.

### Added

- Multi-session substrate for concurrent Kaola-Workflow sessions. Session leases
  are managed by `kaola-workflow-claim.js` (claim, release, heartbeat, sweep,
  status subcommands). A pre-commit hook (`kaola-workflow-pre-commit.sh`) blocks
  cross-session git commits to prevent merge conflicts when multiple sessions
  target different workflow projects simultaneously. Session initialization is
  available in `workflow-init` and `workflow-next`, with heartbeat renewal at
  each phase entry to keep the lease fresh. Support files are installed to
  `~/.claude/kaola-workflow/` by `install.sh`.
- `scripts/kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js`: branch-per-issue auto-merge sink — 10-step rebase-then-ff-merge sequence with merge-base skip-check, FF retry loop (MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES=3), exit codes 0/1/2, and OFFLINE support via `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`.
- `scripts/kaola-workflow-roadmap.js`: per-issue ROADMAP.md regenerator with `generate`, `migrate`, `validate`, and `init-issue` subcommands. `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` files replace direct ROADMAP.md writes; ROADMAP.md is regenerated only at Phase 6 Step 7 and detected-stale by workflow-next validate. Eliminates ROADMAP.md merge conflicts when multiple sessions work simultaneously.
- `cmdPatchBranch` subcommand in `kaola-workflow-claim.js`: backfills branch name in lock file, Sink block, and GitHub claim comment for Stage 1 migration.
- Phase 1 Step 6: Cut Feature Branch — worktree-clean check, idempotent `git checkout -b`, and Stage 1 migration support.
- `Branch:` line in `workflow-next.md` Required Output Before Routing block for explicit branch tracking.
- `scripts/kaola-workflow-classifier.js`: parallel-work classifier invoked in Startup Step 0 of `workflow-next.md` before claim. Classifies open GitHub issues as `green`, `yellow`, `red`, or `blocked` based on lock-file claimed sets, coarse file-area overlap, shared-infra detection (`scripts/`, `hooks/`), and `depends-on:#N` label resolution via `gh issue view`. Config at `~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` (`parallel_mode: auto`). OFFLINE conservative mode: `blocked` when `depends-on` detected; issues already in lock files are filtered before classification (exit code 2).
- `scripts/kaola-workflow-sink-pr.js`: PR-based sink — pushes branch, opens GitHub PR via `gh pr create`, records PR URL and PR number in lock file, `## Sink` block of `workflow-state.md`, and `phase6-summary.md`. Supports `pr_auto_merge: true` config for `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`. OFFLINE mode writes `OFFLINE_PLACEHOLDER` and exits 0.
- `commands/workflow-next-pr.md`: thin wrapper (≤40 lines) that sets `KAOLA_SINK=pr` and delegates to `/workflow-next`. Use when Phase 6 should open a PR instead of a local FF merge.
- `kaola-workflow-claim.js` `watch-pr` subcommand: scans all `.lock` files with `sink: pr` and a `pr_url`; calls `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt,url,number,closedAt` for each; releases MERGED/CLOSED leases automatically; refreshes heartbeat on OPEN PRs. Invoked at `/workflow-next` Startup Step 0 between sweep and classify.
- `kaola-workflow-claim.js`: extracted `releaseSession(root, sessionId, reason)` helper from `cmdRelease` body (DRY — used by both `cmdRelease` and `cmdWatchPr`).

### Changed

- `kaola-workflow-claim.js`: `updateSinkLease` now writes real branch name at claim time (was always `TBD`).
- `kaola-workflow-phase6.md`: Step 8 renamed to `## Step 8 - Sink`; conditional `case "$SINK_KIND"` dispatch reads `sink:` field from `## Sink` block; defaults to `merge` for backward compatibility with pre-feature claims.
- `install.sh`: `kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js` and `kaola-workflow-sink-pr.js` added to script copy loop.
- `kaola-workflow-claim.js`: `claim --sink {merge|pr}` flag; `sink:` field written to lock file and `## Sink` block; `pr_url:`/`pr_number:` fields added to lock schema; `updateSinkLease` now rebuilds the full `## Sink` block via `buildSinkBlock` helper.
- `commands/workflow-next.md`: `watch-pr` invocation added to Startup Step 0 (order: sweep → watch-pr → classify → claim); `KAOLA_SINK_FLAG` propagated to `claim` call from `KAOLA_SINK` env var.
- `simulate-workflow-walkthrough.js`: Epic Cases 2 (OFFLINE fast-path), 3 (rebase path), and 4 (FF race exhaustion) added for sink-merge integration testing.
- `validate-workflow-contracts.js`: stale assertions replaced; 10 new `assertIncludes` checks added for sink-merge contract validation.

## Codex plugin 1.1.1 - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Raised the Codex `planner` role to `xhigh` reasoning effort to match the
  Claude Code Opus-backed planner role.
- Documented that Codex role profiles do not pin model names and added contract
  validation for the managed reasoning-effort map.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Made routine Kaola-Workflow bookkeeping autonomous, including generated
  workflow project names, collision suffixes, and internal advisor-backed
  strategy/plan decisions.
- Added Claude `/goal` or Stop-hook guidance and equivalent Codex skill goal
  contracts so workflow phases continue until their objectives are complete.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Renamed the project, GitHub repository, Claude Code plugin, Codex plugin,
  commands, skills, managed agent profiles, and artifact directory to
  `Kaola-Workflow` / `kaola-workflow`.
- Updated install docs for the `KaolaBrother/Kaola-Workflow` repository and
  `kaolabrother-kaola-workflow` marketplaces.
- Kept state repair and compact-resume compatibility for pre-rename active
  workflow artifact directories.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Made `kaola-workflow-next` locate the Codex repair-state script from the
  installed Codex plugin cache when the workflow pack is not checked out inside
  the target project.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added Codex-native agent profile installation for the Kaola-Workflow pack.
- Added Codex install, update, verification, and release-versioning guidance to
  the README.

### Changed

- Bumped the root workflow package and Claude plugin manifest to `2.1.0`.
- Bumped the Kaola-Workflow plugin manifest to `0.2.0` for the new Codex agent
  profile install surface.
