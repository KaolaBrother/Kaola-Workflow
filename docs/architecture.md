## Phase 6 Finalization and Sink Flow

Phase 6 delivers completed work through one of two sink paths:

### Merge Sink (Default)

```
Final commit on feature branch
    ↓
Fetch and rebase onto origin/main
    ↓
Fast-forward merge with retry loop (3 attempts)
    ↓
Push to origin/main
    ↓
GitHub issue closure
    ↓
Branch cleanup
    ↓
Archive active folder to kaola-workflow/archive/{project}/
```

**Success condition**: Branch merges without conflicts, push succeeds.

**Failure handling**: On merge-impossible error (branch protected, non-fast-forward, permission denied), sink-merge exits code 3 and Phase 6 automatically pivots to PR sink.

### PR Sink (Intent-Based or Fallback)

```
Final commit on feature branch
    ↓
Push branch to origin
    ↓
Create PR via gh pr create / glab mr create
    ↓
Record PR metadata (URL, number) in workflow-state.md
    ↓
Create metadata follow-up commit (chore: record PR metadata for {project})
    ↓
Worktree is clean, folder remains active
    ↓
Next /workflow-next startup: watch-pr detects MERGED/CLOSED
    ↓
Archive folder to kaola-workflow/archive/{project}/
```

**Success condition**: Branch pushed, PR created, metadata recorded, follow-up commit written.

**Worktree state**: Clean after PR sink completes. The metadata follow-up commit is intentional and necessary — it captures the `pr_url` and `pr_number` that downstream workflows need.

**Folder lifecycle**: Active folder remains open until `watch-pr` (on next `/workflow-next` startup) detects the PR state. MERGED and CLOSED results both archive the folder.

### Sink Selection

1. **Intent detection** (recommended): If user prompt contains PR keywords ("open a PR", "create a PR", "pull request", "sink=pr"), agent sets `KAOLA_SINK=pr` before startup, and sink-pr is used.
2. **Default merge**: `sink: merge` is the fallback when no PR intent is detected.
3. **Auto-fallback**: When merge is configured but fails with exit 3, Phase 6 automatically pivots to PR sink.
