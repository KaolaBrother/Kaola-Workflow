## Sink API

The Phase 6 sink is responsible for delivering completed work to the repository and updating GitHub/GitLab metadata.

### Merge Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-merge.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: merge` is configured
- **Contract**: Atomic fetch, rebase onto `origin/main`, fast-forward merge with race-condition retry (MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES=3), branch deletion, and issue closure
  - GitHub: uses `gh` CLI
  - GitLab: uses `glab` CLI and GitLab forge API
  - Gitea: uses `tea` CLI
- **Live workflow-state guard** (`assertNoLiveWorkflowFolder`):
  - All three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) refuse to merge a branch whose HEAD still contains `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`
  - Uses `git cat-file -e HEAD:{path}` to inspect committed tree state (not just filesystem)
  - Exits 1 with detailed remediation instructions when live folder detected
  - Guards against accidentally merging incomplete workflows that skip finalization
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: merge succeeded, branch pushed, issue closed
  - `1`: merge failed (non-recoverable; includes live workflow-state guard failures)
  - `2`: fast-forward race condition exhausted after MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES attempts
  - `3`: merge-impossible error (branch protected, non-fast-forward, permission denied); also returned if project archive dir exists during receipt write (GitLab/Gitea guard); auto-fallback to PR sink
- **Failure classification** (`classifyMergeError` function):
  - Exported from all three sink-merge modules (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
  - Classifies push/merge errors into: `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null` (unclassifiable)
  - GitLab and Gitea additionally support forced merge-impossible state via `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE` env var (test hook)
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` skips all network calls (applies to all three editions)

### PR Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-pr.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-mr.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-pr.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: pr` is configured, or auto-fallback from merge sink exit 3
- **Contract**: Push branch, create PR/MR via `gh pr create` or `glab mr create`, record PR URL and number in workflow-state.md `## Sink` block, then create deliberate metadata follow-up commit (`chore: record PR metadata for {project}`) to leave worktree clean
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: PR/MR created successfully, metadata commit written, worktree clean
  - `1`: branch push or PR/MR creation failed
- **Metadata commit**: Automatic follow-up commit written by sink script after PR creation; not a user action
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` writes `OFFLINE_PLACEHOLDER` commit instead of real PR/MR metadata; applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions
- **Config**: `pr_auto_merge` key in `~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` enables `gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch` (GitHub only, non-fatal if disabled by branch protection rules)

## Environment Variables — Test Hooks

The following environment variables are **test-only hooks** used by the test suite to simulate failure scenarios. Do not use in production.

### Sink-Merge Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_FF_FAIL=N`** — Fail the first N fast-forward merge attempts in `ffMergeLoop`. Used to test FF race-condition retry logic. Applies to both GitHub and GitLab editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE=token`** — Force a merge-impossible error in `postMergeCleanup` by throwing a synthetic error. The token becomes the classification result returned by `classifyMergeError`. Used to test auto-fallback-to-PR behavior. Applies to both GitHub and GitLab editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_DEBUG_CWD=path`** — When set, sink-merge writes the final `process.cwd()` to the specified file on exit. Used by test suite to verify CWD restoration after worktree removal. Applies to both editions.

### Offline and Derivation Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`** — Skip all network calls (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API, git fetch, git push). Used for local testing without network access. Applies to all three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea).
- **`KAOLA_KERNEL_SESSION_FAKE_PID=<pid>`** — Override process-tree walk for kernel-derived session identity testing. Used to test session derivation without Claude Code context.

## Configuration

Configuration files control workflow behavior and issue sorting.

### Global config

`~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional):

```json
{
  "parallel_mode": "auto",
  "pr_auto_merge": false
}
```

- `parallel_mode` — Parallel-work classification strategy (`auto` or other); see README § Classifier configuration
- `pr_auto_merge` — Enable automatic PR merge after creation (GitHub only, requires branch protection rules)

### Project-local config

`kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional, checked into repo):

```json
{
  "priority_top_tier_labels": ["hotfix", "critical"]
}
```

- `priority_top_tier_labels` — Array of custom priority labels that sort as tier 1 (high priority) regardless of P-label. Overrides default `["P0", "P1"]` when present. If not an array or missing, falls back to `["P0", "P1"]`. Read by `readPriorityConfig` in `scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js` at startup to customize issue sort order.

## Module Exports — Public API Functions

The following functions are exported from sink and claim modules for use by test suites and advanced integrations:

### GitHub Edition

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `classifyMergeError(error)` — Classifies a push/merge error into `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null`. Used by `postMergeCleanup` to determine merge-impossible conditions and trigger fallback-to-PR behavior.

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js`:**
- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Derives the coordination root (shared state directory) from a repository root. Returns `<repo>/.git/kaola-workflow/` when `.git` is a directory, or falls back to `<repo>/kaola-workflow/` for worktrees.

### GitLab Edition

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `classifyMergeError(error)` — Classifies a push/merge error (same contract as GitHub). Additionally respects `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE` test hook for deterministic merge-impossible simulation.
- `closeLinkedIssue(root, project, issueIid, opts)` — GitLab-specific function to close a linked issue after merge. Used in test scenarios.
- `fastForwardMain(args, opts)` — Legacy single-pass merge implementation (used by tests).
- `finalValidationPassed(root, project)` — Checks `phase6-summary.md` for final validation evidence. Required before direct merge runs.
- `runDirectMerge(args, opts)` — Main entry point for the direct merge pipeline. Performs all 9 steps (fetch, rebase, FF retry, test, push, close issue, delete branch).

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js`:**
- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Same contract as GitHub edition. Derives the coordination root for shared state storage.
- `cmdSinkFallback()` — Fallback sink implementation invoked when merge sink fails. Checks both live folder and archive folder before updating state; returns `{updated: false, reason: 'project archived'}` if either path does not exist (live) or archive path exists, preventing recreation of archived projects. Otherwise updates sink state to `mr` and returns `{updated: true, sink: 'mr', reason}`. This is called after merge sink exits 3 during auto-fallback.

### Gitea Edition

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-forge.js`:**
- `teaExec(args, opts)` — Execute `tea` CLI commands with version validation (tea >= 0.9.2). Supports `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` for offline testing and optional `execFileSync` injection for test runners.
- `labelsOf(raw)` — Extract label names from mixed label objects (strings or objects with `.name` or `.title` properties).
- `uniqueLabels(raw)` — Return deduplicated label names.
- `preserveWorkflowLabels(currentLabels, nextLabels)` — Ensure workflow labels (`workflow:in-progress`, `workflow:queued`) are preserved when updating issue labels.
- `normalizeState(raw)` — Normalize issue/PR state strings to `open`, `closed`, or `merged`.
- `normalizeProject(raw)` — Normalize Gitea project objects to canonical form: `{owner, name, full_name, html_url}`.
- `normalizeIssue(raw)` — Normalize Gitea issue objects to canonical form: `{number, issue_iid, id, title, body, state, labels, updated_at, url}`.
- `normalizePullRequest(raw)` — Normalize Gitea PR objects to canonical form: `{number, pr_number, id, title, state, pr_url, source_branch, target_branch}`.
- `discoverProject(opts)` — Discover current project via `tea repo view` or git remote fallback.
- `listIssues(opts)` — List all issues (default limit 100, supports state filter).
- `viewIssue(issueNum, opts)` — Fetch a single issue by number.
- `updateIssueLabels(project, issueNum, opts)` — Add or remove labels from an issue.
- `closeIssue(issueNum, opts)` — Close an issue by number.
- `createIssueComment(project, issueNum, body, opts)` — Create a comment on an issue.
- `listIssueComments(project, issueNum, opts)` — List all comments on an issue.
- `updateIssueComment(project, issueNum, commentId, body, opts)` — Update an issue comment.
- `createPullRequest(opts)` — Create a pull request with optional source/target branch, title, and description.
- `viewPullRequest(prNumber, opts)` — Fetch a single PR by number.
- `listPullRequests(opts)` — List all pull requests.
- `mergePullRequest(project, prNumber, opts)` — Merge a PR with optional squash and branch removal. When `opts.sha` is set, passes it as `head_commit_id` in the merge request body (Gitea API field; issue #121).
- `checkServerVersion(opts)` — Verify Gitea server version is ≥ 1.17 by reading the `version` field from `/api/v1/version`. Throws if server is too old. Called automatically by `mergePullRequest` when `opts.autoMerge` is set.
- `checkRepoSquashEnabled(project, opts)` — Validate that the Gitea repository supports squash merges before attempting a squash merge. Throws an error if squash is not enabled.
- `ensureLabel(project, labelDef, opts)` — Create a label if it does not exist; return existing label if found.

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-pr.js`:**
- `ensurePullRequest(args, opts)` — Create or reuse a pull request. Returns `{pr, project}` with PR metadata (url, number, state, source_branch) and project info (full_name, html_url). Automatically updates `workflow-state.md` Sink block with pr_url, pr_number, full_name, and project_html_url.
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: PR created/reused successfully, metadata recorded in workflow-state.md and phase6-summary.md

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `ensureMergeReady(args, opts)` — Validate final merge conditions and execute the merge pipeline. Returns merge result with exit code.
- `readProjectInfo(root, project)` — Read project full_name and html_url from workflow-state.md, with fallback to `discoverProject()` from git remote.
- `finalValidationPassed(root, project)` — Check if phase6-summary.md contains passing final validation evidence.
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: merge succeeded, branch pushed, issue closed, worktree cleaned
  - `2`: fast-forward race condition exhausted after MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES attempts
  - `3`: merge-impossible error (branch protected, non-fast-forward, permission denied); auto-fallback to PR sink
