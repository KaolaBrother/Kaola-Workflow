## Startup Classifier and Remote Validation

When the startup (`/workflow-next` → Startup Step 0) or explicit-target claim (`cmdStartup`, `cmdPickNext`) attempts to validate an issue against the remote forge, a network call is made to check issue state and openness. If the forge API call fails outside `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`, the classifier now returns a **typed `target_unavailable` verdict** instead of silently returning `green`.

### Verdict: `target_unavailable`

- **Returned when**: Remote issue validation fails (GitHub `gh`, GitLab `glab`, or Gitea `tea` CLI call fails) and `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` is NOT set
- **Applies to**: `cmdStartup --target-issue N`, `cmdPickNext`, and parallel-work classifier verdict logic
- **Impact**: Startup refuses to claim the target issue, agent must diagnose the network problem, and retry when the forge is reachable
- **Offline fallback**: When `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`, classification proceeds without remote validation and uses local `.roadmap/issue-N.md` evidence only
- **Helper function**: New `probeIssueState(issueNum, opts)` in `scripts/kaola-workflow-active-folders.js` (all three forge editions) returns `{state, closed}` when the remote is reachable, or throws a typed error when unreachable

## Sink API

The Phase 6 sink is responsible for delivering completed work to the repository and updating GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea metadata.

### Merge Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-merge.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: merge` is configured
- **Contract**: Atomic fetch, rebase onto `origin/main`, fast-forward merge with race-condition retry (MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES=3), branch deletion, and issue closure
  - GitHub: uses `gh` CLI
  - GitLab: uses `glab` CLI and GitLab forge API
  - Gitea: uses `tea` CLI
- **Pre-merge guards** (validated before fetch and rebase):
  - **Live workflow-state guard** (`assertNoLiveWorkflowFolder`):
    - All three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) refuse to merge a branch whose HEAD still contains `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`
    - Uses `git cat-file -e HEAD:{path}` to inspect committed tree state (not just filesystem)
    - Exits 1 with detailed remediation instructions when live folder detected
    - Guards against accidentally merging incomplete workflows that skip finalization
  - **Unpushed-commits guard** (`assertBranchPushedToUpstream`, issue #137):
    - All three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) block merge if feature branch has unpushed commits ahead of its upstream tracking ref
    - Also blocks when no upstream tracking ref is set (branch not pushed yet)
    - Reports branch name, upstream ref, ahead count, and up to 5 representative commit titles in error message
    - Exits 1 with remediation hint (`git push -u origin <branch>`)
    - Prevents accidental merge of incomplete or out-of-sync branches
    - Skipped when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: merge succeeded, branch pushed, issue closed
  - `1`: merge failed (non-recoverable; includes pre-merge guard failures: live workflow-state, unpushed commits, or no upstream tracking ref)
  - `2`: fast-forward race condition exhausted after MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES attempts
  - `3`: merge-impossible error (branch protected, non-fast-forward, permission denied); also returned if project archive dir exists during receipt write (GitLab/Gitea guard); auto-fallback to PR sink
- **Failure classification** (`classifyMergeError` function):
  - Exported from all three sink-merge modules (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
  - Classifies push/merge errors into: `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null` (unclassifiable)
  - GitLab and Gitea additionally support forced merge-impossible state via `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE` env var (test hook)
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` skips all network calls (applies to all three editions)

### PR Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-pr.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-mr.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-pr.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: pr` is configured, or auto-fallback from merge sink exit 3
- **Contract**: Push branch, create PR/MR via `gh pr create` (GitHub), `glab mr create` (GitLab), or `tea pr create` (Gitea), record PR URL and number in workflow-state.md `## Sink` block, then create deliberate metadata follow-up commit (`chore: record PR metadata for {project}`) to leave worktree clean
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: PR/MR created successfully, metadata commit written, worktree clean
  - `1`: branch push or PR/MR creation failed
- **Metadata commit**: Automatic follow-up commit written by sink script after PR creation; not a user action
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` writes `OFFLINE_PLACEHOLDER` commit instead of real PR/MR metadata; applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions
- **Config**: `pr_auto_merge` key in `~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` enables auto-merge after PR creation (GitHub + Gitea editions; non-fatal if merge fails). `mr_auto_merge` key enables the same for GitLab edition. Reads config internally; no dispatch changes required.

## Environment Variables — Test Hooks

The following environment variables are **test-only hooks** used by the test suite to simulate failure scenarios. Do not use in production.

### Sink-Merge Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_FF_FAIL=N`** — Fail the first N fast-forward merge attempts in `ffMergeLoop`. Used to test FF race-condition retry logic. Applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE=token`** — Force a merge-impossible error in `postMergeCleanup` by throwing a synthetic error. The token becomes the classification result returned by `classifyMergeError`. Used to test auto-fallback-to-PR behavior. Applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_DEBUG_CWD=path`** — When set, sink-merge writes the final `process.cwd()` to the specified file on exit. Used by test suite to verify CWD restoration after worktree removal. Applies to all three editions.

### Offline and Derivation Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`** — Skip all network calls (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API, git fetch, git push). Used for local testing without network access. Applies to all three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea).
- **`KAOLA_KERNEL_SESSION_FAKE_PID=<pid>`** — Override process-tree walk for kernel-derived session identity testing. Used to test session derivation without Claude Code context.

## Configuration

Configuration files control workflow behavior and issue sorting.

### Global config

`~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional):

```json
{
  "parallel_mode": "auto",
  "pr_auto_merge": false,
  "mr_auto_merge": false
}
```

- `parallel_mode` — Parallel-work classification strategy (`auto` or other); see README § Classifier configuration
- `pr_auto_merge` — Enable automatic PR merge after creation (GitHub + Gitea editions; squash merge with source branch deletion; non-fatal if merge fails)
- `mr_auto_merge` — Enable automatic MR merge after creation (GitLab edition; equivalent to `glab mr merge --auto-merge`; non-fatal if merge fails)

### Project-local config

`kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional, checked into repo):

```json
{
  "priority_top_tier_labels": ["hotfix", "critical"]
}
```

- `priority_top_tier_labels` — Array of custom priority labels that sort as tier 1 (high priority) regardless of P-label. Overrides default `["P0", "P1"]` when present. If not an array or missing, falls back to `["P0", "P1"]`. Read by `readPriorityConfig` in `scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js` at startup to customize issue sort order.

## Roadmap Operations

### Script: `kaola-workflow-roadmap.js`

Manages the local roadmap mirror (`kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md`) and per-issue metadata files (`kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-{N}.md`).

**Subcommands:**

- **`generate`** — Regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Atomic write-replace; no change = no-op. Guards against replacing a non-empty generated ROADMAP when the `.roadmap/` source directory is missing.
- **`validate`** — Asserts `ROADMAP.md` is current with `.roadmap/` sources. Exits 0 if match; exits 1 and prints remediation message if stale.
- **`validate-remote`** — Detects closed-remote drift: iterates `.roadmap/issue-*.md` marked `status: open` and checks if each issue is closed on the remote (via GitHub/GitLab/Gitea APIs). Reports issues that should have been finalized. Exits 0 if no drift; exits 1 with remediation guidance if drift found. Skips all network calls when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`.
- **`migrate`** — One-time migration: parses the current `ROADMAP.md` table and creates per-issue `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` files. Skips existing files.
- **`init-issue --issue N [--title ...] [--status ...] [--workflow-project ...] [--next-step ...]`** — Creates a single `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` entry. Exclusive creation (fails if file already exists).
- **`project-name --issue N`** — Reads the `workflow_project` field from `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` and outputs it to stdout. Used by claim scripts to resolve project folder names. Exits 1 if field is missing or `"—"`.

**Roadmap Closure Cleanup (Automatic):**

When an active workflow folder is finalized (`cmdFinalize`) or archived after a PR merge (`watch-pr` on MERGED status), the closure process automatically removes the corresponding `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` file and regenerates `ROADMAP.md`. This ensures the local roadmap never contains stale entries for closed issues. The cleanup is scoped to closed-status archives only; abandoned folders leave the roadmap entry untouched (so the issue can be reopened if needed).

## Module Exports — Public API Functions

The following functions are exported from sink and claim modules for use by test suites and advanced integrations:

### GitHub Edition

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `classifyMergeError(error)` — Classifies a push/merge error into `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null`. Used by `postMergeCleanup` to determine merge-impossible conditions and trigger fallback-to-PR behavior.

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js`:**
- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Derives the coordination root (shared state directory) from a repository root. Returns `<repo>/.git/kaola-workflow/` when `.git` is a directory, or falls back to `<repo>/kaola-workflow/` for worktrees.

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-roadmap.js`:**
- `regenerateRoadmap(root)` — Silently regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Returns `'generated'` if content changed, `'up-to-date'` if no change. Used by claim scripts during finalization to clean up roadmap entries. Does not print to stdout.
- `validateRemote(root)` — Detects closed-remote drift by checking each open-status entry in `.roadmap/issue-*.md` against remote issue state. Returns array of issue numbers that are marked open locally but closed on the remote. Empty array indicates no drift.
- `readRoadmapIssues(dir)` — Parses all `.roadmap/issue-*.md` files in a directory and returns an array of issue objects (with `issue`, `title`, `status`, `workflow_project`, `next_step` fields). Filters out invalid entries.
- `roadmapDir(root)` — Returns the path to `.roadmap/` directory (utility function).
- `buildRoadmapContent(issues)` — Constructs the markdown table for `ROADMAP.md` from an issue array. Used by generate subcommand.

### GitLab Edition

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**

- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Same contract as GitHub edition. Derives the coordination root for shared state storage.
- `cmdSinkFallback()` — Fallback sink implementation invoked when merge sink fails. Checks both live folder and archive folder before updating state; returns `{updated: false, reason: 'project archived'}` if either path does not exist (live) or archive path exists, preventing recreation of archived projects. Otherwise updates sink state to `mr` and returns `{updated: true, sink: 'mr', reason}`. This is called after merge sink exits 3 during auto-fallback.

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-roadmap.js`:**
- `regenerateRoadmap(root)` — Silently regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Returns `'generated'` if content changed, `'up-to-date'` if no change. Used by claim scripts during finalization to clean up roadmap entries. Does not print to stdout.

## Stale Worktree Detection

### Script: `kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check`

Detects Git worktrees and branches for issues that are no longer active. A worktree or branch is considered "stale" when its linked issue is closed (as reported by GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API) OR its project folder is archived locally (exists in `kaola-workflow/archive/{project}`), AND the issue is not currently in the active folder set.

**Invocation:**

```bash
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

**GitLab edition:**

```bash
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

**Gitea edition:**

```bash
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

The JSON return shape is identical across all three forges. GL/GT editions match branches on their forge-specific prefix (`workflow/gitlab-issue-*` / `workflow/gitea-issue-*`) instead of the GitHub `workflow/issue-*` prefix.

**Output schema (JSON):**

```json
{
  "stale_worktrees": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/worktree",
      "branch": "workflow/issue-42",
      "head": "abc123def456",
      "issue_number": 42,
      "state": "clean|dirty|missing"
    }
  ],
  "stale_branches": [
    {
      "branch": "workflow/issue-43",
      "issue_number": 43
    }
  ],
  "active_worktrees": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/active/worktree",
      "branch": "workflow/issue-44",
      "issue_number": 44
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

**Output fields:**

- **`stale_worktrees`** — Registered Git worktrees (from `git worktree list --porcelain`) whose linked issue is closed or archived, and not in the active folder set.
  - `path` — Filesystem path to the worktree
  - `branch` — Branch name (e.g., `workflow/issue-42`)
  - `head` — Current HEAD commit hash from worktree metadata
  - `issue_number` — Issue number extracted from branch name (via regex `workflow/issue-(\d+)`)
  - `state` — Worktree filesystem state: `clean` (no modifications), `dirty` (uncommitted changes), or `missing` (registered but directory deleted)

- **`stale_branches`** — Local Git branches named `workflow/issue-*` (detected via `git for-each-ref refs/heads/workflow/`) that have no corresponding registered worktree AND whose linked issue is closed or archived, and not in the active folder set.
  - `branch` — Branch name
  - `issue_number` — Issue number extracted from branch name

- **`active_worktrees`** — Registered worktrees whose linked issue is still open and active (appears in the active folder set).
  - `path`, `branch`, `issue_number` — Same as stale worktrees

- **`count`** — Total number of stale items (sum of `stale_worktrees.length + stale_branches.length`)

**Stale detection logic:**

For each worktree or branch:

1. Extract the issue number from the branch name using regex `workflow/issue-(\d+)`.
2. Check if the issue is active (in the set of active folder issue numbers from `workflow-state.md`).
3. If active: skip (not stale).
4. Otherwise, check if the issue is closed OR archived:
   - **Closed**: Call GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API to check issue state (skipped when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`).
   - **Archived**: Check if `kaola-workflow/archive/issue-<N>` exists locally.
5. If either condition is true, mark the worktree/branch as stale.

**Offline mode** (`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`):

When offline, GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API calls are skipped. Stale detection uses only the archive-existence check. Worktrees/branches for archived issues are still reported as stale, but worktrees/branches for closed (but not archived) issues are not reported.

**Exit code:**

- `0` — Execution succeeded; JSON output written to stdout
