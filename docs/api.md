# API

Document public APIs, endpoints, schemas, events, and integration contracts.

## Startup Classifier and Remote Validation

When the startup (`/workflow-next` → Startup Step 0) or explicit-target claim (`cmdStartup`, `cmdPickNext`) attempts to validate an issue against the remote forge, a network call is made to check issue state and openness. If the forge API call fails outside `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`, the classifier now returns a **typed `target_unavailable` verdict** instead of silently returning `green`.

### Verdict: `target_unavailable`

- **Returned when**: Remote issue validation fails (GitHub `gh`, GitLab `glab`, or Gitea `tea` CLI call fails) and `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` is NOT set
- **Applies to**: `cmdStartup --target-issue N`, `cmdPickNext`, and parallel-work classifier verdict logic
- **Impact**: Startup refuses to claim the target issue, agent must diagnose the network problem, and retry when the forge is reachable
- **Offline fallback**: When `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`, classification proceeds without remote validation and uses local `.roadmap/issue-N.md` evidence only
- **Helper function**: New `probeIssueState(issueNum, opts)` in `scripts/kaola-workflow-active-folders.js` (all three forge editions) returns `{state, reason}`. `state` is `open`, `closed`, or `unavailable`; claim scripts treat `unavailable` as the typed refusal path outside explicit offline mode.

## Sink API

The Phase 6 sink is responsible for delivering completed work to the repository and updating GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea metadata.

### Merge Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-merge.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: merge` is configured
- **Contract**: Atomic fetch, rebase onto `origin/main`, fast-forward merge with race-condition retry (MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES=3), branch deletion, and issue closure
  - GitHub: uses `gh` CLI
  - GitLab: uses `glab` CLI and GitLab forge API
  - Gitea: uses `tea` CLI
- **Pre-merge guards** (validated before fetch and rebase):
  - **Live workflow-state guard** (`assertNoLiveWorkflowFolder`):
    - All three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) refuse to merge a branch whose HEAD still contains `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`
    - Uses `git cat-file -e HEAD:{path}` to inspect committed tree state (not just filesystem)
    - Exits 1 with detailed remediation instructions when live folder detected
    - Guards against accidentally merging incomplete workflows that skip finalization
  - **Unpushed-commits guard** (`assertBranchPushedToUpstream`, issue #137):
    - All three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea) block merge if feature branch has unpushed commits ahead of its upstream tracking ref
    - Also blocks when no upstream tracking ref is set (branch not pushed yet)
    - Reports branch name, upstream ref, ahead count, and up to 5 representative commit titles in error message
    - Exits 1 with remediation hint (`git push -u origin <branch>`)
    - Prevents accidental merge of incomplete or out-of-sync branches
    - Skipped when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: merge succeeded, branch pushed, issue closed
  - `1`: merge failed (non-recoverable; includes pre-merge guard failures: live workflow-state, unpushed commits, or no upstream tracking ref)
  - `2`: fast-forward race condition exhausted after MAX_AUTOMERGE_RETRIES attempts
  - `3`: merge-impossible error (branch protected, non-fast-forward, permission denied); also returned if project archive dir exists during receipt write (GitLab/Gitea guard); auto-fallback to PR sink
- **Failure classification** (`classifyMergeError` function):
  - Exported from all three sink-merge modules (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
  - Classifies push/merge errors into: `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null` (unclassifiable)
  - GitLab and Gitea additionally support forced merge-impossible state via `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE` env var (test hook)
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` skips all network calls (applies to all three editions)

### PR Sink

- **Script**: `kaola-workflow-sink-pr.js` (GitHub) / `kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-mr.js` (GitLab) / `kaola-gitea-workflow-sink-pr.js` (Gitea)
- **Invocation**: Called from Phase 6 Step 9 when `sink: pr` is configured, or auto-fallback from merge sink exit 3
- **Contract**: Push branch, create PR/MR via `gh pr create` (GitHub), `glab mr create` (GitLab), or `tea pr create` (Gitea), record PR URL and number in workflow-state.md `## Sink` block, then create deliberate metadata follow-up commit (`chore: record PR metadata for {project}`) to leave worktree clean
- **Exit codes**:
  - `0`: PR/MR created successfully, metadata commit written, worktree clean
  - `1`: branch push or PR/MR creation failed
- **Metadata commit**: Automatic follow-up commit written by sink script after PR creation; not a user action
- **Offline support**: `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` writes `OFFLINE_PLACEHOLDER` commit instead of real PR/MR metadata; applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions
- **Config**: `pr_auto_merge` key in `~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` enables auto-merge after PR creation (GitHub + Gitea editions; non-fatal if merge fails). `mr_auto_merge` key enables the same for GitLab edition. Reads config internally; no dispatch changes required.

## Environment Variables — Test Hooks

The following environment variables are **test-only hooks** used by the test suite to simulate failure scenarios. Do not use in production.

### Sink-Merge Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_FF_FAIL=N`** — Fail the first N fast-forward merge attempts in `ffMergeLoop`. Used to test FF race-condition retry logic. Applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE=token`** — Force a merge-impossible error in `postMergeCleanup` by throwing a synthetic error. The token becomes the classification result returned by `classifyMergeError`. Used to test auto-fallback-to-PR behavior. Applies to GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea editions.
- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_DEBUG_CWD=path`** — When set, sink-merge writes the final `process.cwd()` to the specified file on exit. Used by test suite to verify CWD restoration after worktree removal. Applies to all three editions.

### Offline and Derivation Test Hooks

- **`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`** — Skip all network calls (GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API, git fetch, git push). Used for local testing without network access. Applies to all three editions (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea).
- **`KAOLA_KERNEL_SESSION_FAKE_PID=<pid>`** — Override process-tree walk for kernel-derived session identity testing. Used to test session derivation without Claude Code context.

## Configuration

Configuration files control workflow behavior and issue sorting.

### Global config

`~/.config/kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional):

```json
{
  "parallel_mode": "auto",
  "pr_auto_merge": false,
  "mr_auto_merge": false
}
```

- `parallel_mode` — Parallel-work classification strategy (`auto` or other); see README § Classifier configuration
- `pr_auto_merge` — Enable automatic PR merge after creation (GitHub + Gitea editions; squash merge with source branch deletion; non-fatal if merge fails)
- `mr_auto_merge` — Enable automatic MR merge after creation (GitLab edition; equivalent to `glab mr merge --auto-merge`; non-fatal if merge fails)

### Project-local config

`kaola-workflow/config.json` (optional, checked into repo):

```json
{
  "priority_top_tier_labels": ["hotfix", "critical"]
}
```

- `priority_top_tier_labels` — Array of custom priority labels that sort as tier 1 (high priority) regardless of P-label. Overrides default `["P0", "P1"]` when present. If not an array or missing, falls back to `["P0", "P1"]`. Read by `readPriorityConfig` in `scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js` at startup to customize issue sort order.

## Roadmap Operations

### Script: `kaola-workflow-roadmap.js`

Manages the local roadmap mirror (`kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md`) and per-issue metadata files (`kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-{N}.md`).

**Subcommands:**

- **`generate`** — Regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Atomic write-replace; no change = no-op. Guards against replacing a non-empty generated ROADMAP when the `.roadmap/` source directory is missing.
- **`validate`** — Asserts `ROADMAP.md` is current with `.roadmap/` sources. Exits 0 if match; exits 1 and prints remediation message if stale.
- **`validate-remote`** — Detects closed-remote drift: iterates `.roadmap/issue-*.md` marked `status: open` and checks if each issue is closed on the remote (via GitHub/GitLab/Gitea APIs). Reports issues that should have been finalized. Exits 0 if no drift; exits 1 with remediation guidance if drift found. Skips all network calls when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`.
- **`migrate`** — One-time migration: parses the current `ROADMAP.md` table and creates per-issue `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` files. Skips existing files.
- **`init-issue --issue N [--title ...] [--status ...] [--workflow-project ...] [--next-step ...]`** — Creates a single `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` entry. Exclusive creation (fails if file already exists).
- **`project-name --issue N`** — Reads the `workflow_project` field from `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` and outputs it to stdout. Used by claim scripts to resolve project folder names. Exits 1 if field is missing or `"—"`.

**Roadmap Closure Cleanup (Automatic):**

When an active workflow folder is finalized (`cmdFinalize`) or archived after a PR merge (`watch-pr` on MERGED status), the closure process automatically removes the corresponding `.roadmap/issue-{N}.md` file and regenerates `ROADMAP.md`. This ensures the local roadmap never contains stale entries for closed issues. The cleanup is scoped to closed-status archives only; abandoned folders leave the roadmap entry untouched (so the issue can be reopened if needed).

## Module Exports — Public API Functions

The following functions are exported from sink and claim modules for use by test suites and advanced integrations:

### GitHub Edition

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `classifyMergeError(error)` — Classifies a push/merge error into `permission_denied`, `branch_protected`, `non_fast_forward`, or `null`. Used by `postMergeCleanup` to determine merge-impossible conditions and trigger fallback-to-PR behavior.

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js`:**
- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Derives the coordination root (shared state directory) from a repository root. Returns `<repo>/.git/kaola-workflow/` when `.git` is a directory, or falls back to `<repo>/kaola-workflow/` for worktrees.

**`scripts/kaola-workflow-roadmap.js`:**
- `regenerateRoadmap(root)` — Silently regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Returns `'generated'` if content changed, `'up-to-date'` if no change. Used by claim scripts during finalization to clean up roadmap entries. Does not print to stdout.
- `validateRemote(root)` — Detects closed-remote drift by checking each open-status entry in `.roadmap/issue-*.md` against remote issue state. Returns array of issue numbers that are marked open locally but closed on the remote. Empty array indicates no drift.
- `readRoadmapIssues(dir)` — Parses all `.roadmap/issue-*.md` files in a directory and returns an array of issue objects (with `issue`, `title`, `status`, `workflow_project`, `next_step` fields). Filters out invalid entries.
- `roadmapDir(root)` — Returns the path to `.roadmap/` directory (utility function).
- `buildRoadmapContent(issues)` — Constructs the markdown table for `ROADMAP.md` from an issue array. Used by generate subcommand.

### GitLab Edition

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-sink-merge.js`:**
- `classifyMergeError(error)` — Classifies a push/merge error (same contract as GitHub). Additionally respects `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_FORCE_MERGE_IMPOSSIBLE` test hook for deterministic merge-impossible simulation.
- `closeLinkedIssue(root, project, issueIid, opts)` — GitLab-specific function to close a linked issue after merge. Used in test scenarios.
- `fastForwardMain(args, opts)` — Legacy single-pass merge implementation (used by tests).
- `finalValidationPassed(root, project)` — Checks `phase6-summary.md` for final validation evidence. Required before direct merge runs.

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js`:**
- `getCoordRoot(root)` — Same contract as GitHub edition. Derives the coordination root for shared state storage.
- `cmdSinkFallback()` — Fallback sink implementation invoked when merge sink fails. Checks both live folder and archive folder before updating state; returns `{updated: false, reason: 'project archived'}` if either path does not exist (live) or archive path exists, preventing recreation of archived projects. Otherwise updates sink state to `mr` and returns `{updated: true, sink: 'mr', reason}`. This is called after merge sink exits 3 during auto-fallback.

**`plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-roadmap.js`:**
- `regenerateRoadmap(root)` — Silently regenerates `ROADMAP.md` from `.roadmap/issue-*.md` sources. Returns `'generated'` if content changed, `'up-to-date'` if no change. Used by claim scripts during finalization to clean up roadmap entries. Does not print to stdout.
- `validateRemote(root)` — Detects closed-remote drift by checking each open-status entry in `.roadmap/issue-*.md` against GitLab issue state. Returns array of issue IIDs that are marked open locally but closed on the remote.

## Stale Worktree Detection

### Script: `kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check`

Detects Git worktrees and branches for issues that are no longer active. A worktree or branch is considered "stale" when its linked issue is closed (as reported by GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API) OR its project folder is archived locally (exists in `kaola-workflow/archive/{project}`), AND the issue is not currently in the active folder set.

**Invocation:**

```bash
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

**GitLab edition:**

```bash
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

**Gitea edition:**

```bash
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

The JSON return shape is identical across all three forges. GL/GT editions match branches on their forge-specific prefix (`workflow/gitlab-issue-*` / `workflow/gitea-issue-*`) instead of the GitHub `workflow/issue-*` prefix.

**Output schema (JSON):**

```json
{
  "stale_worktrees": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/worktree",
      "branch": "workflow/issue-42",
      "head": "abc123def456",
      "issue_number": 42,
      "state": "clean|dirty|missing"
    }
  ],
  "stale_branches": [
    {
      "branch": "workflow/issue-43",
      "issue_number": 43
    }
  ],
  "active_worktrees": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/active/worktree",
      "branch": "workflow/issue-44",
      "issue_number": 44
    }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

**Output fields:**

- **`stale_worktrees`** — Registered Git worktrees (from `git worktree list --porcelain`) whose linked issue is closed or archived, and not in the active folder set.
  - `path` — Filesystem path to the worktree
  - `branch` — Branch name (e.g., `workflow/issue-42`)
  - `head` — Current HEAD commit hash from worktree metadata
  - `issue_number` — Issue number extracted from branch name (via regex `workflow/issue-(\d+)`)
  - `state` — Worktree filesystem state: `clean` (no modifications), `dirty` (uncommitted changes), or `missing` (registered but directory deleted)

- **`stale_branches`** — Local Git branches named `workflow/issue-*` (detected via `git for-each-ref refs/heads/workflow/`) that have no corresponding registered worktree AND whose linked issue is closed or archived, and not in the active folder set.
  - `branch` — Branch name
  - `issue_number` — Issue number extracted from branch name

- **`active_worktrees`** — Registered worktrees whose linked issue is still open and active (appears in the active folder set).
  - `path`, `branch`, `issue_number` — Same as stale worktrees

- **`count`** — Total number of stale items (sum of `stale_worktrees.length + stale_branches.length`)

**Stale detection logic:**

For each worktree or branch:

1. Extract the issue number from the branch name using regex `workflow/issue-(\d+)`.
2. Check if the issue is active (in the set of active folder issue numbers from `workflow-state.md`).
3. If active: skip (not stale).
4. Otherwise, check if the issue is closed OR archived:
   - **Closed**: Call GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API to check issue state (skipped when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`).
   - **Archived**: Check if `kaola-workflow/archive/issue-<N>` exists locally.
5. If either condition is true, mark the worktree/branch as stale.

**Offline mode** (`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`):

When offline, GitHub/GitLab/Gitea API calls are skipped. Stale detection uses only the archive-existence check. Worktrees/branches for archived issues are still reported as stale, but worktrees/branches for closed (but not archived) issues are not reported.

**Exit code:**

- `0` — Execution succeeded; JSON output written to stdout

### Script: `kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup`

Removes stale Git worktrees and branches identified by `stale-worktree-check`. Provides safe, reversible cleanup strategies for both clean and dirty worktrees.

**Invocation:**

```bash
# Dry-run (no changes)
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup

# GitHub edition with all options
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute --archive --keep-branch

# GitLab edition
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute

# Gitea edition
node plugins/kaola-workflow-gitea/scripts/kaola-gitea-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute
```

**Flags:**

- **`--execute`** — Perform actual removal. Without this flag, the command runs in dry-run mode, scanning for stale items and reporting what would be removed without making changes.
- **`--archive`** — For dirty worktrees, stash uncommitted changes before removal. Changes are recoverable via `git stash list`.
- **`--export`** — For dirty worktrees, write a patch file to `kaola-workflow/archive/exports/` before removal. Tracked changes are captured in a `.patch` file (recoverable via `git apply`). Untracked files (which `git diff` does not capture) are copied verbatim into a sibling `issue-N-{timestamp}-untracked/` sidecar directory, preserving their relative paths.
- **`--force`** — For dirty worktrees, discard all uncommitted changes without recovery.
- **`--keep-branch`** — Remove the git worktree but preserve the local branch. Useful for open PRs that should remain available. When omitted, both worktree and branch are deleted.

When no strategy flag (`--archive`, `--export`, or `--force`) is given, dirty worktrees are skipped and reported in the `skipped_dirty` field; no changes are made to them. When more than one strategy flag is given, they are not mutually exclusive and no error is raised — a silent precedence applies: `--archive` takes effect first, then `--export`, then `--force` (`archive > export > force`).

**Behavior:**

1. **Dry-run mode** (default, no `--execute`): Scans for stale worktrees and branches using the same logic as `stale-worktree-check`, prints report of what would be removed, exits without making changes.

2. **Clean worktrees**: Removed via `git worktree remove`. Branches deleted (unless `--keep-branch` is set).

3. **Dirty worktrees** (uncommitted changes):
   - No strategy flag: dirty worktrees are skipped and reported in `skipped_dirty`. No changes are made to them.
   - With `--archive`: Changes are stashed; worktree is removed. User can recover via `git stash list` and `git stash pop`.
   - With `--export`: Tracked changes written to `kaola-workflow/archive/exports/issue-N-{timestamp}.patch` (recoverable via `git apply`). Untracked files copied to a sibling `issue-N-{timestamp}-untracked/` directory. Worktree is removed. Both artifacts are reported in the `exported` field of JSON output.
   - With `--force`: Changes are discarded immediately. Worktree is removed. No recovery path.

4. **Missing worktrees**: Registered in git but filesystem deleted. Branch cleanup still proceeds.

5. **Branch cleanup**: Local branches matching `workflow/issue-*` (GitHub), `workflow/gitlab-issue-*` (GitLab), or `workflow/gitea-issue-*` (Gitea) are deleted unless `--keep-branch` is set.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — Dry-run completed successfully, or removals executed successfully
- `1` — Error during execution (invalid flags, git error, filesystem error)

**JSON output:**

**Dry-run** (no `--execute`):

```json
{
  "dry_run": true,
  "would_remove": [],
  "would_delete_branch": [],
  "skipped_dirty": []
}
```

**Execute** (`--execute`):

```json
{
  "dry_run": false,
  "removed": [],
  "deleted_branch": [],
  "skipped_dirty": [],
  "stashed": [],
  "exported": [],
  "failed_preserve": []
}
```

**Typical cleanup workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Check what's stale
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check

# 2. Dry-run cleanup to see what would be removed
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup

# 3. Review the report and decide on strategy

# 4. Execute with chosen strategy
# For worktrees with uncommitted work:
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute --archive

# Or for worktrees with no work:
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute --force

# 5. For open PRs, preserve branch while removing worktree:
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-cleanup --execute --archive --keep-branch

# 6. Verify cleanup completed
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js stale-worktree-check
```

**Offline mode** (`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`):

The command still removes local worktrees and branches. Archive/export strategies work normally. The detection of which worktrees/branches are "stale" uses only the local archive-existence check (no remote API calls to verify if issues are closed).

## Closure Contract

This section defines the closure-system invariants for a completed linked issue
N. It is the human-readable counterpart to the machine-readable schema in
`scripts/kaola-workflow-closure-contract.js`. As of issue #164, all closure
paths (`cmdFinalize`, `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr`, and `sink-merge`) seed a full
receipt from `emptyReceipt()` via the shared `buildClosureReceipt()` helper and
emit `closure_receipt` plus `closure_invariants` in their JSON output.

### Closure invariants

For a completed linked issue N:

1. `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-N.md` is absent.
2. Generated `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md` does not list `#N` as active work.
3. `kaola-workflow/{project}/` is absent from active folders.
4. `kaola-workflow/archive/{project}/workflow-state.md` exists with `status: closed` and `step: complete` when local archive is available.
5. The remote issue is closed only after acceptance criteria pass and implementation is published.
6. The remote issue does not have `workflow:in-progress` after closure.
7. Any branch/worktree cleanup is either complete or explicitly reported by stale-worktree tooling.

### Closure receipt schema

The closure receipt is an auditable record of every closure step. Field names
and enum values are exported from `scripts/kaola-workflow-closure-contract.js`
as `CLOSURE_RECEIPT_FIELDS`; `emptyReceipt(project, issueNumber)` returns a
receipt with every status field defaulted to `failed` (fail-loud: an
unpopulated receipt reads as total failure, never silent success) and
`warnings` empty.

```json
{
  "project": "issue-N",
  "issue_number": "N",
  "archive": "closed|abandoned|skipped|failed",
  "roadmap_source_removed": "removed|absent|failed",
  "roadmap_regenerated": "regenerated|skipped|failed",
  "remote_issue_closed": "closed|already_closed|skipped_offline|failed",
  "claim_label_removed": "removed|already_absent|skipped_offline|failed",
  "worktree_removed": "removed|missing|kept|failed",
  "branch_removed": "removed|kept|failed",
  "warnings": []
}
```

Offline behavior is explicit: local invariants (1-4) are always checked; remote
actions (`remote_issue_closed`, `claim_label_removed`) record `skipped_offline`
under `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` rather than `failed`.

### `buildClosureReceipt()` helper (issue #164)

`buildClosureReceipt(project, issueNumber, steps)` is the single mapping point
that every closure path uses to produce a receipt. It is exported from each
forge's claim module (`kaola-workflow-claim.js`, `kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js`,
`kaola-gitea-workflow-claim.js`).

1. Seeds the receipt with `emptyReceipt(project, issueNumber)` (every status
   field defaults to `failed`).
2. Overwrites only fields present in `steps` that are valid
   `CLOSURE_RECEIPT_FIELDS`.
3. Appends any `steps.warnings` entries to `receipt.warnings`.

Because seeding is fail-loud, a step the caller never reports stays `failed` —
the receipt can never read as silent success. `sink-merge` reaches the helper
through its existing `require('./kaola-workflow-claim.js')` (no circular
dependency), and the byte-identical Codex copy carries the same export.

### `cmdFinalize` output (issue #162)

`cmdFinalize` emits a JSON result that includes receipt fields populated by
`archiveProjectDir()`. Fields are written before any potential failure so the
record is never silent on partial runs:

```json
{
  "roadmap_source_removed": "removed|absent|failed",
  "roadmap_regenerated": "regenerated|skipped|failed",
  "closure_invariants": {
    "ok": true,
    "violations": []
  }
}
```

`closure_invariants` checks six invariants at closure time (issue #164 adds the
last three local checks; the signature is now `checkClosureInvariants(root,
receipt, archiveDest)`):

- `roadmap-source-absent` — `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-N.md` is gone after cleanup.
- `roadmap-mirror-clean` — generated `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md` no longer lists `#N` as active work.
- `in-progress-label-removed` — `workflow:in-progress` label was removed from the remote issue. Skipped (not violated) when `KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1` or when `claim_label_removed` is `'skipped_offline'`.
- `active-folder-absent` — no live `kaola-workflow/{project}/` folder remains in active folders after archive (issue #164).
- `archive-state-closed` — when `archiveDest` is provided, the archived `workflow-state.md` shows `status: closed` or `abandoned`; skipped (not violated) when `archiveDest` is absent (issue #164).
- `branch-worktree-resolved` — neither `worktree_removed` nor `branch_removed` is `failed` (issue #164).

The `remote-closed-after-publish` invariant (closure invariant 5) is intentionally
deferred to issue #165, where the `remote_issue_closed` field is unified across
all paths.

`ok` is `true` only when `violations` is empty. When `archiveProjectDir()` cannot
complete a receipt step, `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr` surface the failure via a
`warnings` array in their JSON output rather than swallowing the error silently.

`cmdFinalize` output now includes `claim_label_removed` (issue #163):

```json
{
  "roadmap_source_removed": "removed|absent|failed",
  "roadmap_regenerated": "regenerated|skipped|failed",
  "claim_label_removed": "removed|skipped_offline|failed",
  "closure_invariants": {
    "ok": true,
    "violations": []
  }
}
```

`cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr` emit a `cleanups` array with per-folder `claim_label_removed` status when label cleanup is attempted. As of issue #164 each entry also carries the full per-folder `receipt` (built via `buildClosureReceipt`) and its `closure_invariants`:

```json
{
  "watched": 1,
  "cleanups": [{
    "folder": "issue-N",
    "claim_label_removed": "removed",
    "receipt": {
      "project": "issue-N",
      "issue_number": "N",
      "archive": "closed",
      "roadmap_source_removed": "removed",
      "roadmap_regenerated": "regenerated",
      "remote_issue_closed": "skipped_offline",
      "claim_label_removed": "removed",
      "worktree_removed": "removed",
      "branch_removed": "kept",
      "warnings": []
    },
    "closure_invariants": { "ok": true, "violations": [] }
  }]
}
```

The `cleanups[]` and `warnings[]` keys are preserved for backward compatibility;
the `receipt` and `closure_invariants` fields are additive.

### `sink-merge` closure receipt (issue #164)

On a successful direct merge, `sink-merge` (all forges) emits a closure receipt
to stdout after branch cleanup. `sink-merge` is the only path that sets
`remote_issue_closed: 'closed'` and `branch_removed: 'removed'` — it owns the
remote-issue-close and branch-delete steps. `cmdFinalize` and the watchers set
`branch_removed: 'kept'`. The emitted JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "merged",
  "closure_receipt": {
    "project": "issue-N",
    "issue_number": "N",
    "archive": "closed",
    "roadmap_source_removed": "absent",
    "roadmap_regenerated": "skipped",
    "remote_issue_closed": "closed",
    "claim_label_removed": "removed",
    "worktree_removed": "removed",
    "branch_removed": "removed",
    "warnings": []
  },
  "closure_invariants": { "ok": true, "violations": [] }
}
```

`sink-merge` derives `archive`/`roadmap_source_removed` by probing
post-conditions (finalize already archived); `roadmap_regenerated` is `skipped`
because `sink-merge` does not regenerate the mirror. The exit-3
merge-impossible fallback returns before any receipt is emitted and is
unchanged. `sink-merge`'s `ghExec` now honors `KAOLA_GH_MOCK_SCRIPT`, matching
`claim.js`, so the receipt path is testable without a live `gh` CLI.

**`sink:pr` deferral**: `cmdSinkPr` does not emit a closure receipt — it leaves
the active folder open. The authoritative closure receipt for a `sink:pr`
project is emitted by `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr` when the PR/MR merges. This is
documented behavior, not a gap; no schema change is needed.

### `audit-labels` and `repair-labels` (GitHub only, issue #163)

Two subcommands find and fix closed issues that still carry `workflow:in-progress`.

**`audit-labels`** — scan-only, emits JSON:
```json
{ "stale": [{ "number": 127, "title": "...", "url": "..." }], "count": 1 }
```

**`repair-labels`** — dry-run by default, `--execute` performs removal:
```bash
# dry-run (default): shows what would be removed
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js repair-labels

# execute: removes stale labels from all matching closed issues
node scripts/kaola-workflow-claim.js repair-labels --execute
```

Dry-run output:
```json
{ "dry_run": true, "would_remove": [{ "number": 127, "title": "...", "url": "..." }] }
```

Execute output:
```json
{ "dry_run": false, "removed": [127], "failed": [] }
```

GitLab and Gitea receive receipt wiring only (`clearAdvisoryClaim` returns the status enum; `cmdFinalize`/watch commands emit `claim_label_removed`). The `audit-labels`/`repair-labels` subcommands are GitHub-only in this release.

### Closure audit and repair (GitHub only, issue #165)

#### Script: `kaola-workflow-closure-audit.js`

A single command that reports **closure drift** — completed work that still
shows as active — across local roadmap sources, the generated `ROADMAP.md`,
active folders, archive state, remote issue state, and the
`workflow:in-progress` label. It is a dedicated script (invoked directly, like
`sink-merge`), not a `claim.js` subcommand:

```bash
# dry-run (default): report drift as JSON, change nothing
node scripts/kaola-workflow-closure-audit.js

# execute: repair safe local drift + remove stale labels on closed issues
node scripts/kaola-workflow-closure-audit.js --execute
```

**Drift classes reported:**

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `stale_roadmap_sources` | `.roadmap/issue-N.md` exists for a closed issue. `reason` is `closed_remote` (issue N is closed on the forge) or `archive_closed` (an archive `workflow-state.md` says `status: closed` but the source survives). `closed_remote` wins when both apply. |
| `mirror_lists_closed_issues` | Generated `ROADMAP.md` still lists a closed issue (derived from the same closed set). |
| `stale_in_progress_labels` | Closed remote issues that still carry `workflow:in-progress`. |
| `active_folder_for_closed_issue` | An active `kaola-workflow/{project}/` folder whose linked issue is closed. `dirty` flags uncommitted content. **Report-only.** |
| `unarchived_pr_folders` | An active `sink: pr` folder whose PR is `MERGED`/`CLOSED` but was never archived (the watcher never ran). **Report-only.** |

**Dry-run output** (default):
```json
{
  "dry_run": true,
  "offline": false,
  "drift": {
    "stale_roadmap_sources": [{ "issue_number": 127, "file": "kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-127.md", "reason": "closed_remote" }],
    "mirror_lists_closed_issues": [127],
    "stale_in_progress_labels": [{ "number": 127, "title": "...", "url": "..." }],
    "active_folder_for_closed_issue": [{ "project": "issue-150", "issue_number": 150, "dirty": false }],
    "unarchived_pr_folders": [{ "project": "issue-152", "issue_number": 152, "pr_url": "...", "pr_state": "MERGED" }]
  },
  "counts": { "stale_roadmap_sources": 1, "mirror_lists_closed_issues": 1, "stale_in_progress_labels": 1, "active_folder_for_closed_issue": 1, "unarchived_pr_folders": 1 }
}
```

**Execute output** (`--execute`):
```json
{
  "dry_run": false,
  "offline": false,
  "repaired": { "roadmap_sources_removed": [127], "roadmap_regenerated": true, "labels_removed": [127], "labels_failed": [] },
  "reported_not_repaired": { "active_folder_for_closed_issue": [...], "unarchived_pr_folders": [...] }
}
```

**Safe-repair boundary.** `--execute` only ever (1) deletes stale
`.roadmap/issue-N.md` sources, (2) regenerates `ROADMAP.md`, and (3) removes
`workflow:in-progress` from closed issues when online. It **never** deletes
active folders or worktrees. Classes `active_folder_for_closed_issue` and
`unarchived_pr_folders` are carried verbatim into `reported_not_repaired` in
both modes — they may hold un-finalized work, so they are surfaced for a human
(use `finalize`/`release`, or run `watch-pr` for the PR case).

**Offline behavior** (`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`). Local-only classes still run
(`stale_roadmap_sources` via `archive_closed`, `active_folder_for_closed_issue`).
Remote-dependent classes (`stale_in_progress_labels`, `unarchived_pr_folders`)
report the string `"skipped_offline"` rather than an array, and `--execute`
performs no remote label removal. A non-offline `gh` failure reports an empty
array plus a stderr warning — it is never silently downgraded to `skipped_offline`.

#### How this differs from `stale-worktree-check` / `stale-worktree-cleanup`

These cover **disjoint** drift surfaces and are intentionally separate commands:

| | `closure-audit` | `stale-worktree-check` / `-cleanup` |
|---|---|---|
| **Surface** | Roadmap sources, `ROADMAP.md`, active folders, archive state, remote issue state, advisory labels (closure invariants 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) | Git worktrees and branches (closure invariant 7) |
| **Question answered** | "Is finished work still showing as active in local roadmap/folders or as advisory remote state?" | "Are there leftover Git worktrees/branches for closed/archived issues?" |
| **`--execute` repairs** | Stale `.roadmap` sources + regenerate `ROADMAP.md` + remove stale `workflow:in-progress` labels | Removes Git worktrees and deletes local branches (with `--archive`/`--export`/`--force` for dirty worktrees) |
| **Never touches** | Worktrees, branches, **active folders** | Roadmap sources, `ROADMAP.md`, labels, archive folders |

Run both for full closure-drift coverage: `closure-audit` owns roadmap/label/folder
drift; `stale-worktree-check`/`-cleanup` owns worktree/branch drift. `closure-audit`
deliberately **reports but never removes** active folders and unarchived PR folders,
delegating worktree/branch teardown to `stale-worktree-cleanup` and folder teardown
to `finalize`/`release`/`watch-pr`.

### Flow mapping

Existing closure code is mapped to the contract below. This issue documents the
mapping; it does not change any runtime path. Cross-forge parity gaps are named
here and deferred to the listed follow-up issues.

| Closure surface | Invariants covered | Current behavior | Follow-up |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------|
| `cmdFinalize` / `archiveProjectDir` | 1, 2, 3, 4 | **Shipped (#164)**: Seeds full receipt via `buildClosureReceipt`; output includes `closure_receipt` plus `closure_invariants` (6 checks); `worktree_removed` captured, `branch_removed: 'kept'`. `removeLegacyStateBlocks` runs on GitHub but is missing from GitLab/Gitea `archiveProjectDir`. | ~~#162~~ ~~#164~~ |
| `sink-merge` (all forges) | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 | **Shipped (#164)**: Runs `checkClosureInvariants` and emits `closure_receipt` + `closure_invariants` on successful merge; the only path that sets `remote_issue_closed: 'closed'` and `branch_removed: 'removed'`; `ghExec` honors `KAOLA_GH_MOCK_SCRIPT`. Remote-close *assertion* (invariant 5) deferred to #165. | ~~#163~~ ~~#164~~, #165 |
| `sink-pr` / PR-MR fallback | 3, 5 | `cmdSinkPr` leaves the active folder open until `watch-pr`/`watch-mr`; closure receipt is emitted by the watcher at merge (documented deferral, #164). `cmdSinkFallback` live-folder guard checks archive on GitLab/Gitea but GitHub misses that archive check. | ~~#164~~ |
| `watch-pr` / `watch-mr` | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 | **Shipped (#164)**: Per-folder `receipt` + `closure_invariants` attached to each `cleanups[]` entry on MERGED; `cleanups[]`/`warnings[]` preserved. Closure can still be delayed if the watcher never runs (drift detection → #165). | ~~#164~~, #165 |
| `clearAdvisoryClaim` (label cleanup) | 6 | **Shipped (#163)**: Returns `'removed'`/`'skipped_offline'`/`'failed'`; callers capture result into `claim_label_removed` receipt field. `cmdFinalize` has null-folder fallback reading issue number from archive path. `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr` emit `cleanups[]`. GitHub: `audit-labels`/`repair-labels` subcommands for stale-label repair. | |
| `stale-worktree-check` / `stale-worktree-cleanup` | 7 | Reports/removes stale worktrees and branches; relied on for invariant 7's "explicitly reported" clause. Complemented by `closure-audit` (#165), which covers the roadmap/label/folder drift surface (invariants 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and explicitly defers worktree/branch teardown here. | ~~#165~~ |
| `closure-audit` (GitHub, #165) | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 | **Shipped (#165)**: dedicated `kaola-workflow-closure-audit.js` reports stale roadmap sources, mirror-listed closed issues, stale in-progress labels, active folders for closed issues, and unarchived PR folders; `--execute` repairs the safe local roadmap/label classes only. Report-only for folders/PR drift. GitLab/Gitea ports deferred to follow-ups. | |

### Follow-up scope

This issue ships the contract and the machine-readable schema only. Enforcement
and repair are decomposed into:

- #162 — Make roadmap source cleanup mandatory after issue closure (invariants 1, 2). **Shipped**: `archiveProjectDir()` now populates explicit receipt fields (`roadmap_source_removed`, `roadmap_regenerated`); `cmdFinalize` output includes these fields plus `closure_invariants`; `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr` emit `warnings` on receipt failures.
- #163 — Guarantee `workflow:in-progress` label cleanup for closed issues (invariant 6). **Shipped**: `clearAdvisoryClaim()` now returns `'removed'`/`'skipped_offline'`/`'failed'`; `cmdFinalize` and watch commands emit `claim_label_removed`; `checkClosureInvariants` checks the `in-progress-label-removed` invariant (skips when offline); `audit-labels`/`repair-labels` GitHub subcommands for stale-label repair.
- #164 — Unify closure execution behind a shared closure receipt (invariants 1-4, 6, 7). **Shipped**: `buildClosureReceipt()` helper seeds `emptyReceipt()` across all four forge trees; `cmdFinalize`, `cmdWatchPr`/`cmdWatchMr`, and `sink-merge` all emit `closure_receipt` + `closure_invariants`; `checkClosureInvariants` extended with `active-folder-absent`, `archive-state-closed`, `branch-worktree-resolved`; `sink-merge` `ghExec` honors `KAOLA_GH_MOCK_SCRIPT`. Invariant 5 (`remote-closed-after-publish`) and `sink:pr` deferral remain documented-only, deferred to #165.
- #165 — Add closure audit and repair command for stale completed work (drift detection + repair). **Shipped (GitHub edition)**: new dedicated script `kaola-workflow-closure-audit.js` reports six closure-drift classes (invariants 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and, with `--execute`, removes stale `.roadmap` sources + regenerates `ROADMAP.md` + removes stale `workflow:in-progress` labels. Report-only for active folders and unarchived PR folders. GitLab/Gitea ports filed as follow-up issues.
