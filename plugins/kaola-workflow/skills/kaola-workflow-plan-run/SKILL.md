# Skill: kaola-workflow-plan-run

Adaptive executor. Runs a frozen `workflow-plan.md` (`workflow_path: adaptive`) by
traversing its DAG + `## Node Ledger` instead of the fixed phaseN ladder, dispatching
one role node at a time and checkpointing between calls. Mirror of
`commands/kaola-workflow-plan-run.md` for the Codex runtime. Reads and updates
`kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md` throughout.

The plan is author-immutable after freeze, guarded by `plan_hash` (stored inside
`workflow-plan.md`, re-checked every load). A tampered or unparseable plan is a **typed
refusal**, never a silent fallback to the phaseN ladder.

## Resume Detection

On entry (and on every resume), **delegate the re-orientation to the mechanical `contractor`
Codex agent role when that subagent is available** — it runs the integrity + readiness scripts and
reports the durable markers; the current session **judges** which resume branch applies and never
runs these scripts itself. The contractor runs `node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-plan-validator.js"
kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md --resume-check --json` (re-check `plan_hash` + closed-library
membership + structural grammar + hash integrity ONLY — NOT the full gate rubric, which would brick an
in-flight plan if the rubric tightened after freeze) and `node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-next-action.js"
kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md --json` (ready set, next node with resolved `model`, `allDone`),
then reports the `## Node Ledger` + `workflow-state.md` markers verbatim. It never judges, dispatches, or
clears a marker.

The current session then **judges** the resume branch:
- a consent-halt — EITHER `escalated_to_full: consent` in `workflow-state.md` OR
  `consent_halt: pending` in the plan's `## Node Ledger` (#234; non-hashed, survives a
  lost state file) → a provisional auto-run was **revoked at the barrier**; surface the
  pending approval for the user's explicit yes, do NOT re-dispatch. On approval, have the contractor
  REMOVE the Ledger marker AND clear `escalated_to_full: consent` in lockstep, then resume.
- a node `in_progress` with **absent/partial** `.cache/{node-id}.md` → crash mid-node before the role
  finished; re-dispatch exactly that role node. The advance bracket's `--record-base` is **idempotent**
  (#239) — the original baseline is reused, so a crashed attempt's writes stay visible to the barrier.
- a node `in_progress` with **complete** `.cache/{node-id}.md` but the barrier not yet run / the node not
  yet marked `complete` → crash AFTER the role finished but before the commit bracket: **re-run the commit
  bracket only — do NOT re-dispatch the role** (which would redo non-idempotent writes).
- the plan is authored but NOT frozen (`--resume-check` refused with `plan_hash missing` — a prior
  `kaola-workflow-adapt` exited before freezing): do NOT run the loop; route to `kaola-workflow-adapt
  {project}` to complete Govern + freeze (adapt re-enters at freeze), then resume here once frozen.
- otherwise the ready set from `next-action` (each node carrying its resolved `model`) drives the loop:
  nodes whose `status != complete` and all of whose `depends_on` are `complete` with resolved compliance.
  When no node is `in_progress` (e.g. a crash between a node's commit and its fused advance left the next
  node unopened), **re-enter at step 1** to open the next ready node.

## Governance — auto-run only when provably low-risk, else ask

Re-read the validator verdict (`--json`); do not re-derive risk by hand.
- **in-grammar + provably low-risk → auto-run** (sequential, no write-role fan-out,
  declared write set outside every Phase-5 area, no `SHARED_INFRA`, under the file
  ceiling, no loop). This authorization is **provisional**.
- **in-grammar + risky or uncertain → ask the user first** (surface the DAG + validator
  report + risk findings). Risky = any sensitivity (labels OR declared write set touch
  auth / payments / user data / filesystem / external-API / secrets), any WRITE-ROLE
  fan-out (N ≥ 2), `SHARED_INFRA`, over the file ceiling, a bounded loop, or any
  uncertainty (**fail closed**). Read-only verification/research fan-out is
  zero-blast-radius and does **not** trigger ask.
- **out-of-grammar → typed refusal** (unknown role, a gate routed around, a cap busted,
  a non-disjoint write-role fan-out).

## Per-Node Loop

The current session **owns the loop and dispatches the role** (a subagent cannot dispatch a
subagent); it **delegates the mechanical brackets around each role dispatch to the `contractor`
Codex agent role when that subagent is available** — running the scripts and writing the durable
ledger/state — and **judges** the barrier outcome. It never runs the loop scripts itself.

**Task list = the workflow nodes.** The session keeps a task list with one item per `## Nodes` row
(`id · role`, in `depends_on` order) — established by `kaola-workflow-adapt` after freeze, or, on a
direct resume, reconstructed here from the `## Node Ledger`. Mark a node's task `in_progress` when
its role is dispatched (after the advance bracket) and `completed` once its barrier passes in the
commit step (`n/a` → skipped). The task list is a live mirror; the durable `## Node Ledger` stays the
single source of truth, so reconcile to the ledger on every resume rather than trusting a stale list.

The commit of a node and the advance to the next are **fused into ONE contractor call** (step 3) so the
contractor is summoned **once** per node transition, not twice. Step 1 only bootstraps the first node;
thereafter the loop cycles step 2 → 3 → 4 → 2.

1. **advance — open the next ready node when none is `in_progress` (contractor)** — run this to
   bootstrap the first node, and on resume to open the next ready node **whenever no node is
   `in_progress`** (a never-opened first node, or one orphaned by a crash between a node's commit and
   its fused advance); every later advance is fused into step 3, so do not re-run it while a node is
   already `in_progress`. The contractor
   runs `node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-next-action.js"
   kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md --json` (reports ready set / next node / resolved `model` /
   `allDone`), then for the next ready node marks it `in_progress` in the `## Node Ledger` and records its
   per-instance write baseline with `node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-commit-node.js"
   kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md --node-id {node-id} --start --json` (record-base ONLY at node
   start — **idempotent** #239; an end-time baseline would neuter the barrier). If `allDone`, route to finalize.
2. **dispatch** the node's role (current session — Codex delegates to the matching agent profile; resolve
   its model via `kaola-workflow-resolve-agent-model.js`).
3. **commit + advance (contractor)** — after the role returns, the contractor reads `.cache/{node-id}.md` (a
   `tdd-guide` node needs RED then GREEN; counts `test_thrash` ≥ 3 same-test cycles), runs the PER-INSTANCE
   barrier `node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-commit-node.js" kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md
   --node-id {node-id} --json` (re-scans the files the node actually wrote — **script-enforced** #231/#239 —
   diffing the recorded base against the node's OWN declared lane, so a fan-out instance overflowing into a
   SIBLING's lane is refused; Phase 6's whole-plan barrier stays the union-level floor), and ONLY IF the
   barrier exits 0 with RED+GREEN evidence (or a valid `n/a`) marks the node `complete`/`n/a` and emits one
   **`## Required Agent Compliance`** row. Gate compliance rows for `code-reviewer`/`security-reviewer` use
   the **bare role string** (the canonical compliance-row format the full-path anchored delegation matcher
   expects); per-instance disambiguation goes in the Evidence column only. Never mark a gate row `n/a` while
   a node it post-dominates reached `complete`. **Selector routing (ONLY when `selectorCheck.isSelector === true` and `selectorCheck.ok === true`):** read `selectorCheck.armsToNa` from the barrier JSON. For each arm-id in that list, write its `## Node Ledger` row to `n/a` with note `selected: <selectorCheck.selected> (not this arm)`. These writes MUST precede the fused advance so `next-action` sees them as TERMINAL. If `selectorCheck.ok === false` (missing/foreign selector), do NOT mark any arm — report and stop (the orchestrator owns the halt). Non-selector nodes (`selectorCheck.isSelector === false`) require no action. **Then, ONLY IF the barrier exited 0** (the node is now
   `complete`/`n/a`), the contractor FUSES the next advance in the SAME call — re-runs `node
   "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-workflow-next-action.js" kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md --json` and, if
   a next ready node exists, opens it (`in_progress` + `kaola-workflow-commit-node.js --node-id {next}
   --start --json`, idempotent #239), reporting the node opened or `allDone`. On a failed barrier /
   `test_thrash` ≥ 3 / missing evidence it does NOT advance. The contractor never judges sufficiency or
   writes an escalation marker.
4. **judge the barrier (current session — governance).** On barrier exit 0 the node is `complete` and, per
   the fused advance, the next ready node is already open — dispatch it (back to step 2), or route to
   finalize on `allDone`. On barrier exit 1 (a write turned out sensitive —
   a Phase-5 category — on a plan with no `security-reviewer` node, or overflowed outside the declared
   allowlist) the provisional authorization was granted on a now-false premise:
   **revoke and halt for consent** — this **decision** is the session's (the contractor is never a gate);
   have the contractor write
   `escalated_to_full: consent` AND force a `security-reviewer` to post-dominate every remaining sensitive
   node (`escalated_to_full: security`) into `workflow-state.md`, AND write the durable line
   `consent_halt: pending` into the plan's `## Node Ledger` (#234: a non-hashed section, so the halt survives
   a lost/regenerated `workflow-state.md`). `test_thrash` ≥ 3 escalates the same way. (A `code-reviewer` must
   already post-dominate every implement node, and `security-reviewer` every sensitive node — the validator
   computes these from the topology; the executor never drops them.)

> **Enforcement boundary (#231 — now script-enforced).** Gate *presence* is proven
> statically at freeze (post-dominance over the unique sink). Gate *execution* is proven by

## Quorum / decision nodes (read-only fan-out)

After a read-only fan-out (e.g. adversarial-verify with `adversarial-verifier` skeptics),
an orchestrator **quorum/decision** node tallies N schema-validated child verdicts
against a *static* threshold (`tally-fn` ∈ {`majority-refute`, `argmax-score`}) and emits
one accept/kill (or winner) decision, derived solely from the durable per-child ledger
rows (recomputed on resume), each a `verdict: pass|fail` block in `.cache` mechanically
checked by --verdict-check (#251) — there is no `validateNodeOutput()` script; that schema
checkpoint was never script-enforced. The tally arithmetic is prose, not a script. A
failed quorum routes to a bounded self-repair loop or surfaces as a RISKY escalation — it
never drops a wall. `loop-until-dry` terminates on static LOOP_CAP (script-enforced)
plus an agent-tracked dry_streak (orchestrator counts no-change cycles; only LOOP_CAP is validator-enforced).

## Caps

`FANOUT_CAP` (default 4, env `KAOLA_FANOUT_CAP`), `test_thrash` ≥ 3, file overflow
declared+1 / absolute backstop of 6, the static loop bound — enforced per node at the barrier.

## Completion

When every ledger row is `complete` or `n/a`, route to `kaola-workflow-finalize {project}`
(adaptive runs have no `phase5-review.md`; finalize anchors on the all-complete plan).
