description: Initialize a project for Kaola-Workflow with CLAUDE.md guidance, docs structure, and Git/GitLab issue conventions.
argument-hint: (optional project context)

# Workflow Init

<!-- PIN: consent-in-conversation -->
**Consent.** Irreversible and value-laden calls belong to the user — ask, in conversation, before
taking one. Nothing collects that approval on your behalf, so this rule is the whole mechanism.
Initializing a repository, rewriting an existing instructions file that already carries the user's
own content, and editing runtime configuration under `$HOME` are all in that class: propose the
change, show the minimal diff, and wait for the answer. Creating a missing scaffold file is not —
get on with it.
<!-- /PIN -->

Prepare the current project for repeated `/workflow-next` implementation cycles.

This command is a bootstrapper. It should preserve existing project instructions and docs, add only missing workflow guidance, and avoid replacing user-authored content.

## Inputs

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as optional project context.

---

## Step 1 — Scan Project State

Inspect the project root:

```bash
pwd
test -f CLAUDE.md && echo "CLAUDE.md exists" || echo "CLAUDE.md missing"
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
test -d kaola-workflow && find kaola-workflow -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort
find docs -maxdepth 3 -type f 2>/dev/null | sort
test -f package.json && node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); console.log('package scripts:', Object.keys(p.scripts||{}).join(', ')||'none')"
find . -maxdepth 2 \( -name 'Makefile' -o -name 'pyproject.toml' -o -name 'Cargo.toml' -o -name 'go.mod' -o -name 'requirements.txt' \) -print
```

If this is not a Git repository, ask before running `git init`. If it is a Git repository without a remote, record that GitLab issue sync is pending until a GitLab remote exists.

If `glab` is available and a GitLab repo can be inferred from `origin`, inspect open issues:

```bash
glab issue list --limit 100
```

If there is no GitLab remote, or if `glab` is unavailable or unauthenticated, skip issue fetching immediately and note that GitLab issue sync is pending. Do not spend time retrying GitLab calls during init.

---

## Step 2 — Synthesize `CLAUDE.md`

Create `CLAUDE.md` if missing. If it exists, preserve user-authored content and add only missing durable guidance. Do not paste full source files, roadmaps, changelogs, API docs, or long skill text into `CLAUDE.md`.

Recommended size: under 200 lines. This is a recommendation, not a limit — nothing fails on the count, at any size. If the result would exceed it, say so plainly, name what should move to docs, `.claude/rules/`, skills, or `CLAUDE.local.md`, and offer to trim it together rather than stopping.

Use this policy:

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Project Snapshot | yes | What this project is, stack, and main architecture in 2-5 bullets |
| Commands | yes | Install, test, lint/typecheck/build, dev server commands; use `unknown` when not detected |
| Non-Negotiable Rules | yes | Stable constraints agents must follow every session |
| Validation Policy | yes | Treat background hooks as advisory and avoid duplicate validation |
| Kaola-Workflow | yes | Orchestrator, backlog, compliance, and archive rules in concise form |
| Project Conventions | optional | Only real detected or user-provided conventions |
| Known Gotchas | optional | Only repeated hazards that would waste time |
| Documentation Map | yes | Pointers to docs, not embedded docs |
| Maintenance | yes | Rules for keeping `CLAUDE.md` short |

Optional content belongs elsewhere unless it must be read in every session:
- Put path-specific rules in `.claude/rules/*.md`.
- Put private machine/user notes in `CLAUDE.local.md`.
- Put long procedures in skills or command files.
- Put API details, decisions, architecture, and changelog entries in `docs/` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use plain path references for optional docs. Do not use `@path` imports unless the content must always enter context.

### Compact Template

Append equivalent missing sections only. Treat headings with the same meaning as equivalent; do not duplicate. Replace bracketed placeholders with detected values; do not leave placeholder text in `CLAUDE.md`. Omit optional sections when there is no real content.

# Project Instructions

## Project Snapshot

- Purpose: [one sentence from README, package metadata, or user context]
- Stack: [detected languages/frameworks/tools]
- Architecture: [2-3 bullets max, or "unknown"]

## Commands

- Install: `[command or unknown]`
- Test: `[command or unknown]`
- Lint/typecheck/build: `[commands or unknown]`
- Dev server: `[command or unknown]`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Think before coding: state assumptions, surface ambiguity, and ask when unclear.
- Read before writing: inspect the target file and relevant surrounding conventions immediately before editing or creating files.
- Keep it simple: solve the requested problem without speculative abstractions.
- Make surgical changes: touch only what the task requires.
- Goal-driven execution: Define verifiable success criteria before starting. Keep the tests in separate custody from the code they judge — whoever implements a behavior does not author its tests. Loop until criteria pass; don't declare done on weak signals.
- Verify facts, don't fabricate: do not guess API/library behavior, interfaces, or signatures — confirm them against documentation, source, or a run before relying on them. Do not claim to understand code, errors, or requirements you have not verified; name what you do not know and find out.
- Reuse before adding: before writing a new interface, search for an existing equivalent and extend it rather than duplicate functionality.
- Escalate irreversible changes: do not unilaterally make hard-to-reverse changes or alter a user-owned contract (public API, schema or data migration, dependency or build-tooling swap, deletion of working capability); state the decision and its evidence, then get confirmation before proceeding.

## First Principles

These are the workflow's tie-breaking axioms, applied in priority order whenever a situation is not already settled.

1. **Correct first.** Never trade correctness for speed or cost; rework is the most expensive outcome.
2. **Then save human time.** Remove manual steps and shorten the wait, without weakening axiom 1.
3. **Then spend as little as possible.** Use the cheapest sufficient mechanism — parallelism, extra agents, and higher model tiers are means, not goals.
4. **Machines decide facts; humans decide values.** Take irreversible and value-laden calls to the user and ask, in conversation; leave everything checkable to run automatically.
5. **Own your own verdicts.** Never let a system the workflow does not own (CI, an external service) be the judge of done.

**Tie-breaker protocol:** when nothing else covers a situation, resolve it by walking these axioms in order and record a one-line derivation alongside the work. Recording it is useful and never required.

**Dispatch production; keep decisions:** the orchestrator's context is the run's scarcest resource — a handoff costs once, inline residue taxes every later decision — so delegating discretionary production is the default and only the deciding stays inline; weigh the economics per case by judgment, with no justifier, evidence line, or approval attached.

**Parallel by default:** concurrency is the standing default for independent work, and work that genuinely feeds other work runs in order because it has to. Nothing inspects that choice — no proof, no evidence line, no cap: you can tell the difference, and the frontier is in front of you. Width stays sized to the true shape of the task rather than pushed as wide as it will go.

## Kaola-Workflow

<!-- KW-CLAUDE-MANAGED-START -->
Everything between this marker and its matching END below is owned by `workflow-init`: a later run
may replace it in full. Nothing outside the two markers is touched — that content, wherever you have
added or changed it in this file, is yours.

- Start and resume all workflow work through the workflow router entrypoint your runtime installs.
- A run claims an explicitly selected set of issues — normally three to five, sometimes one — each open, unclaimed, and closeable on its own evidence, and records what it owns in `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`: which issues, which branch, which worktree. An issue runs alone when it moves something the others read, when closing it needs a value call from the user, or when its scope is not knowable until it has been investigated.
- `kaola-workflow/{project}/mission-list.md` is the run's coordination record and the one file a successor needs. No script owns this file; you write it. An H1 carrying the goal in one line, then one item per mission.
- An item is a **mission, not a specification**. One line of prose: what to achieve, plus the hints and facts you already know. It carries no role, no file list, no dependency edge, no model, no cardinality and no shape, because you decide all of that when you reach it.
- The frontier is not computed — it is the list minus done minus in-flight, visible by reading. When you reach an item, decide whether to dispatch subagents or do the work yourself, and at what width.
- **Three write moments.** These are the whole discipline. **Created** — write `item` and `status: todo`. **Dispatched** — write `dispatched` and flip `status` to `in-flight`, **before the work goes out**. Writing it afterwards is precisely the failure this file exists to prevent. Name **where the output was to land** — that locator is what makes recovery possible at all. **Closed** — write `result` and flip `status` to `done`.
- Delegate work to the vendored subagents by default; the main session owns orchestration, review, validation, integration, and final decisions. Subagents and worktrees are tools — offered, and declinable.
- Name roles by function and reasoning tier, never by a vendor model name — write `planner (reasoning tier)`, not `planner (<model>)`. Keep this section runtime-neutral so it reads correctly on every runtime that reads this repo.
- For read/research work, spawn `code-explorer` for codebase research and `knowledge-lookup` when external library/API behavior or open-web/expertise knowledge that cannot be confirmed locally is needed.
- Custody, not order, splits the two writing roles: `tdd-guide` authors the tests and writes no production code; `implementer` writes the production code and reads and runs the tests but never writes them.
- Route build/type/lint validation failures to `build-error-resolver`; route behavior, coverage, and test-defect failures back to `tdd-guide`, the role that owns the test artifact.
- Route documentation work to `doc-updater`, and require it to transcribe verified ground truth — real command output, real signatures, existing schema — or to say what it needs; never let it invent field names, keys, enum values, or example numbers.
- Use the vendored agent role names exactly as installed; prefer short names like `planner`. When spawning a Kaola subagent, pass the role's configured model on the spawn call — each agent ships its model in its installed profile.
- At workflow-router startup, fetch remote-tracking refs, classify local/upstream sync state, and ask before any risky synchronization.
- Use a persistent-objective prompt so work continues until its objective and completion audit are satisfied.
- That objective prompt must not use "next issue in line" or any phrasing that implies automatic cross-issue continuation. Each workflow run targets one selected set of issues; finishing the set is the terminal event. The completion contract requires explicit re-direction for the next set.
- Treat nonessential workflow bookkeeping as autonomous: generated project names, collision suffixes like `-2`, cache/artifact paths, and harmless ordering choices are selected automatically and recorded.
- For essential technical decisions, apply your own judgment, apply the selected answer, and say what the evidence was.
- Take irreversible and value-laden calls to the user and ask, in conversation, before acting: risky Git synchronization, destructive rewrites, deployment or credential actions, and issue reorganization. Nothing collects that approval for you.
<!-- PIN: forge-is-the-backlog -->
- GitLab issues are the backlog: title, labels and comments are what the work is — comments override the body.
- `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/_rules.md` is the one optional local file that survives, for standing
  project-local rules read directly; nothing else is generated or tracked under
  `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/`.
<!-- /PIN -->
- Active work lives in `kaola-workflow/{project}/` until archived or safely discarded.
<!-- PIN: forge-is-the-backlog -->
- Roadmap/research sessions create or refine issues on the forge; workflow runs implement one selected set — there is no local mirror to refresh.
<!-- /PIN -->
- After resume or compaction, read `workflow-state.md` and `mission-list.md` before continuing: the H1 is the goal, `done` items carry what is already known, `in-flight` items are the decision to make, `todo` items are what remains.
- Resuming an `in-flight` item means looking for the WORK, not the worker: if the output its `dispatched` line promised has landed, close it; otherwise re-dispatch, unless the dispatch is provably still alive.
- End each cycle by docking docs against code changes, resolving closure decisions, updating issues, archiving completed workflow folders, and then the final commit and push.
- Active issue work runs in a repo-local worktree at `<repo-root>/.kw/worktrees/<project>/` by default; set `KAOLA_WORKTREE_NATIVE=0` to disable. See README for the full contract.
<!-- PIN: forge-is-the-backlog -->
- Top-priority labels: declare in `kaola-workflow/config.json` (`priority_top_tier_labels`) when the repo uses something other than P0–P3 naming.

> **Claude dispatch posture note:** Audit dispatch posture for this session before claiming
> role-dispatch readiness: probe the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` environment variable
> first; if unset, fall back to the session settings env block. Report
> `claude_dispatch_posture: teams | classic` — `teams` when the flag resolves truthy, `classic`
> otherwise. This audit is report-only: never write or edit user settings/config to flip the
> flag. Remediation leads with the classic path — the synchronous dispatch flow is always

Keep the working-principle bullets concise.

If an existing `CLAUDE.md` is bloated or duplicates the sections above, do not silently replace it. Add a short `## Maintenance Note` with the proposed consolidation and ask before destructive rewriting.

---

## Step 3 — Create `AGENTS.md`

Check whether `AGENTS.md` exists in the project root. Detect conformance by
reading the second non-blank line: if it equals
`> **MANDATORY — READ CLAUDE.md BEFORE ANY ACTION THIS SESSION.**`,
the file is conforming — no-op. If the file is missing, write the canonical
redirect block below. If the file exists but is non-conforming (second
non-blank line does not match), prepend the redirect block, add a `---`
divider, then append the original content with the migration note line.

Worked example of a migrated AGENTS.md (two `---` dividers total):

```text
# AGENTS.md

> **MANDATORY — READ CLAUDE.md BEFORE ANY ACTION THIS SESSION.**
>
> `CLAUDE.md` in this repository root is the **single canonical source** for all
> non-negotiable rules, project conventions, workflow constraints, and agent
> behavior. AGENTS.md exists **only** to direct you there.
>
> **Required at session start, before any tool call, edit, or response:**
>
> 1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in full.
> 2. Treat its `## Non-Negotiable Rules` section as binding for every action you take in this repo.
> 3. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing, **stop and ask the user** — do not proceed on assumptions.
>
> Do not skip this step because the task looks small. Do not rely on prior
> session memory. Re-read on every new session.

---

*All other guidance — the workflow, scripts, conventions, gotchas — lives in `CLAUDE.md`. This file intentionally contains nothing else.*

---
> Note: the content below is the AGENTS.md contract.
[original content here]
```

Canonical `AGENTS.md` redirect block to write:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

> **MANDATORY — READ CLAUDE.md BEFORE ANY ACTION THIS SESSION.**
>
> `CLAUDE.md` in this repository root is the **single canonical source** for all
> non-negotiable rules, project conventions, workflow constraints, and agent
> behavior. AGENTS.md exists **only** to direct you there.
>
> **Required at session start, before any tool call, edit, or response:**
>
> 1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in full.
> 2. Treat its `## Non-Negotiable Rules` section as binding for every action you take in this repo.
> 3. If `CLAUDE.md` is missing, **stop and ask the user** — do not proceed on assumptions.
>
> Do not skip this step because the task looks small. Do not rely on prior
> session memory. Re-read on every new session.

---

*All other guidance — the workflow, scripts, conventions, gotchas — lives in `CLAUDE.md`. This file intentionally contains nothing else.*
```

## Step 4 — Create Missing Workflow Structure

Create only missing directories/files. Do not overwrite existing content.

Required structure:

```text
kaola-workflow/
  archive/
docs/
  README.md
  architecture.md
  api.md
  conventions.md
  decisions/
CHANGELOG.md
```

Use these initial file bodies when a file is missing.

### `docs/README.md`

```markdown
# Documentation Index

- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [API](api.md)
- [Conventions](conventions.md)
- [Decisions](decisions/)
- [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)
```

### `docs/architecture.md`

```markdown
# Architecture

Document system boundaries, major components, data flow, and deployment shape.
```

### `docs/api.md`

```markdown
# API

Document public APIs, endpoints, schemas, events, and integration contracts.
```

### `docs/conventions.md`

```markdown
# Conventions

Document coding style, testing rules, Git practices, naming, and review expectations.
```

### `CHANGELOG.md`

```markdown
# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Initialized Kaola-Workflow documentation structure.
```

## Active Folder Initialization

If a GitLab issue is known, create the active workflow folder before starting:

```bash
kaola_script(){ _n="$1"; _self=""; [ -f "./package.json" ] && _self="$(node -e "try{process.stdout.write(require(process.cwd()+'/package.json').name||'')}catch(e){}" 2>/dev/null)"; if [ "$_self" = "kaola-workflow" ]; then for _p in "./plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/$_n" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/$_n}" "$HOME/.claude/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/$_n"; do [ -f "$_p" ] && { printf '%s\n' "$_p"; return; }; done; else for _p in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/$_n}" "$HOME/.claude/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/$_n" "./plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/$_n"; do [ -f "$_p" ] && { printf '%s\n' "$_p"; return; }; done; fi; return 1; }
CLAIM_JS="$(kaola_script kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js)"
[ -f "$CLAIM_JS" ] && node "$CLAIM_JS" claim \
  --project "{project}" --issue {N}
```

Replace `{project}` with the workflow project folder name (e.g., `multi-session-substrate`) and `{N}` with the GitLab issue number. If the issue number is unknown, omit `--issue`.

If `kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js` is unavailable (manual install without the script), skip this step and proceed with local workflow artifacts.

---

## Step 5 — Git And Issue Summary

After edits:

1. Run `git status --short --branch`.
2. Run `wc -l CLAUDE.md` and report the count against the recommended 200 lines. If it is over, offer to trim it with the user — the count fails nothing.
3. Summarize:
   - whether Git is initialized
   - whether a GitLab remote exists
   - whether `CLAUDE.md` was created or updated
   - whether AGENTS.md was created, was already conforming, or was migrated
   - which required `CLAUDE.md` sections are present
   - which docs files were created
   - whether GitLab issues were available for sync
4. Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.

End with the next useful entry point:

```text
/workflow-next
```
