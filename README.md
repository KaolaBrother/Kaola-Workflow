# Kaola-Workflow

A 6-phase development workflow for Claude Code and Codex with per-phase file artifacts, multi-model orchestration, and full resumability across sessions and context resets.

## Autonomy And Goal Contract

Kaola-Workflow is goal-driven. For Claude Code, use `/goal` or equivalent
prompt-based Stop-hook wording so a workflow turn continues until the current
phase objective and completion audit are genuinely satisfied. For Codex, the
same contract lives in the Kaola-Workflow skills: continue until the phase
objective, evidence, and `workflow-state.md` next pointer are complete.

Routine workflow bookkeeping is autonomous. Generated project/folder names,
collision suffixes such as `-2`, cache/artifact paths, and ordering that does
not affect user intent should be chosen automatically and recorded. Essential
technical decisions should consult the configured expert internally, then apply
and record the chosen answer: Claude Code uses the advisor/Opus path, while
Codex uses the strongest available expert model or agent profile for the
session. Prompt the user only for true external authorization or materially
user-owned choices, such as risky Git synchronization, destructive rewrites,
credential or deployment actions, or issue/roadmap reorganization.

## Dependency — Everything Claude Code (ECC)

> **This plugin requires ECC to be installed.**
>
> The workflow delegates work to ECC-provided agents at each phase:
>
> | Agent | Phase | Model |
> |-------|-------|-------|
> | `code-explorer` | 1 — Research/Discovery (code facts) | Sonnet |
> | `docs-lookup` | 1 — Research/Discovery (external docs, when needed) | Sonnet |
> | `planner` | 2 — Ideation | Opus |
> | `code-architect` | 3 — Plan | Sonnet |
> | `tdd-guide` | 4 — Execute (per-task TDD executor) | Sonnet |
> | `build-error-resolver` | 4–6 — Validation repair when needed | Sonnet |
> | `code-reviewer` | 5 — Review | Sonnet |
> | `security-reviewer` | 5 — Review (conditional) | Sonnet |
> | `doc-updater` | 6 — Finalize | Haiku |
>
> Install ECC first:
>
> ```text
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code
> /plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
> ```
>
> ECC's current npm package name is `ecc-universal`; the older `everything-claude-code`
> npm package name is not the active install surface.
>
> The Opus advisor gates in Phases 2, 3, and conditional Phase 5 require
> `"advisorModel": "opus"` in `~/.claude/settings.json` or an equivalent
> Claude Code advisor configuration.
>
> If ECC is installed only as a Claude Code plugin, agents may appear with the
> `everything-claude-code:` prefix. The workflow supports either form.
>
> In ECC terms, `tdd-guide` is the spawnable agent. `tdd-workflow` is the
> maintained TDD playbook that the agent follows for RED → GREEN → REFACTOR.

## Installation

### As a Claude Code plugin

From Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/KaolaBrother/Kaola-Workflow
/plugin install kaola-workflow@kaolabrother-kaola-workflow
/reload-plugins
```

If you previously used the manual installer, remove or update user-level command
files such as `~/.claude/commands/workflow-next.md` or the legacy
`~/.claude/commands/kaola-workflow.md`; user-level commands can take
precedence over plugin commands.

Then run:

```text
/workflow-init
/workflow-next
```

### Manual command install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaolaBrother/Kaola-Workflow.git
cd Kaola-Workflow
./install.sh
```

Plugin uninstall:

```text
/plugin uninstall kaola-workflow
```

Manual command uninstall:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## Codex Pack

This repository also includes a self-use Codex pack under
`plugins/kaola-workflow/`. It exposes the same Kaola-Workflow identity through
Codex-native skills, using `kaola-workflow/` project artifacts and `AGENTS.md`
guidance rather than Claude Code slash commands and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Install On Another Computer

Prerequisites:

- Codex is installed and authenticated on the target computer.
- The target computer can access this GitHub repository.
- Restart Codex after adding, upgrading, installing, or enabling the plugin.

Fresh install from GitHub:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add KaolaBrother/Kaola-Workflow
codex
```

Then install or enable `kaola-workflow` from the `kaolabrother-kaola-workflow`
marketplace in the Codex plugin directory. For direct config enablement, add:

```toml
[plugins."kaola-workflow@kaolabrother-kaola-workflow"]
enabled = true
```

After restarting Codex, open the target project and ask Codex to initialize the
workflow:

```text
Use Kaola-Workflow for Codex in this repo.
Run workflow-init for Kaola-Workflow for Codex.
```

Install from a local clone when working offline or testing local changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaolaBrother/Kaola-Workflow.git
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/Kaola-Workflow
```

Update an existing Codex install to the newest marketplace version:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade kaolabrother-kaola-workflow
```

Restart Codex, then rerun `kaola-workflow-init` in any project that should
receive the newest managed agent profiles and project config.

To verify a project was initialized for Codex, check that `.codex/config.toml`
contains a `# BEGIN kaola-workflow agents` managed block and that
`.codex/agents/kaola-workflow/` contains the role profile files.

The primary skills are:

```text
kaola-workflow-init
kaola-workflow-next
kaola-workflow-research
kaola-workflow-ideation
kaola-workflow-plan
kaola-workflow-execute
kaola-workflow-review
kaola-workflow-finalize
```

The Codex pack keeps the same six-phase shape, state repair, compliance ledger,
TDD evidence, review, documentation docking, roadmap refresh, archive, and final
Git gate. It does not depend on ECC agents. Instead, `kaola-workflow-init`
automatically installs Codex-native role profiles that mirror the ECC workflow
roles:

```text
code-explorer
docs-lookup
planner
code-architect
tdd-guide
build-error-resolver
code-reviewer
security-reviewer
doc-updater
```

The managed setup copies role configs into `.codex/agents/kaola-workflow/` and
maintains a `# BEGIN kaola-workflow agents` block in `.codex/config.toml` while
preserving unrelated config. When Codex subagents are available, phases use
those roles for detached research, planning, execution, repair, review, and
documentation work; otherwise the current Codex session follows the same role
contracts locally.

Codex profiles intentionally do not pin model names, so model upgrades can flow
through the user's active Codex configuration. They only set reasoning effort:

| Role | Reasoning effort |
| --- | --- |
| `code-explorer` | `medium` |
| `docs-lookup` | `medium` |
| `planner` | `xhigh` |
| `code-architect` | `high` |
| `tdd-guide` | `medium` |
| `build-error-resolver` | `medium` |
| `code-reviewer` | `high` |
| `security-reviewer` | `high` |
| `doc-updater` | `low` |

There is no separate Codex advisor role. Codex advisor gates use the strongest
available expert model/profile for the current session, or the current session
performs the same review locally when no detached advisor profile is available.

## Release Versioning

Current official release versions:

- Claude Code `kaola-workflow` package/plugin: `3.1.0`
- Codex `kaola-workflow` plugin manifest: `1.1.1`

The root `package.json` version is the official repository and Claude Code
release version. The Codex plugin has its own manifest version in
`plugins/kaola-workflow/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; bump it whenever the Codex
plugin install surface, skills, agent profiles, or workflow behavior changes.

Use SemVer for both versions:

- `MAJOR`: breaking command, artifact, plugin, or workflow-contract changes.
- `MINOR`: backward-compatible workflow phases, agent roles, install features,
  or new automation.
- `PATCH`: compatible bug fixes, validation fixes, documentation-only updates,
  or small install clarifications.

Official release checklist:

```bash
npm test
git diff --check
git tag kaola-workflow-v3.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

Create a tag only when publishing a tagged release. For normal development
pushes, update the versions and changelog, run validation, commit, and push the
branch.

## Usage

Initialize each project once:

```
/workflow-init
```

This creates or updates a compact `CLAUDE.md`, `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md`, and the baseline documentation map without replacing existing project guidance. The generated `CLAUDE.md` keeps commands, hard rules, workflow pointers, and documentation links in root memory while leaving long details in docs or skills.

In any Claude Code session, run:

```
/workflow-next
```

The command is a thin router. It first checks local/remote Git state, safely fast-forwards clean behind-only branches, and asks before risky synchronization such as diverged history, dirty worktrees with upstream changes, rebases, merges, stashes, resets, or conflicts. It then scans `kaola-workflow/`, reads `workflow-state.md` when present, and routes to the right phase command:

```text
/kaola-workflow-phase1
/kaola-workflow-phase2
/kaola-workflow-phase3
/kaola-workflow-phase4
/kaola-workflow-phase5
/kaola-workflow-phase6
```

## GitHub Roadmap Cycle

Use a separate research or roadmap session to discover future work and create or refine GitHub issues. `/workflow-next` is the implementation cycle: it fetches open GitHub issues, mirrors active unfinished work into `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md`, advances one selected item, then comments on or closes linked issues after validation.

The local roadmap is a working mirror, not the source of truth. Keep only active unfinished work there; completed workflow folders move to `kaola-workflow/archive/`.

The workflow also enforces context discipline: `CLAUDE.md` targets under 200 lines, the local roadmap should not become history storage, and agent prompts should include only the relevant phase excerpts needed for the delegated task.

Each phase records a required-agent compliance ledger. Each active workflow also maintains `workflow-state.md`, which records the current phase, intra-phase step, next command, pending gates, and ownership rules. After resume or compaction, the main session must read that state file and the relevant compliance ledger before continuing.

Avoid redundant validation runs: Phase 4 uses targeted affected checks, Phase 5 validates only review fixes or cites existing evidence, and Phase 6 runs each full final command once against the final candidate state. Small targeted commands may run in the main session, while expensive or noisy test/lint/type/build commands should be delegated and summarized from cache evidence.

## ECC Hook Policy

ECC hooks are background hygiene, not workflow validation. They may format,
lint, or typecheck edited files automatically, but `/workflow-next` should not
rerun the same check unless the phase requires broader validation or relevant
files changed after the hook ran. Hook output counts as workflow evidence only
when recorded with command, scope, result, and evidence path.

For heavy Phase 4 implementation bursts or many subagents, use the lighter hook
profile:

```bash
ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal claude
```

Phase 6 still owns the final full relevant validation gate. It also performs
documentation docking to match code changes with docs and issue/roadmap state,
uses an advisor-backed closure decision gate when deferred or conflict items
remain, and leaves commit and push as the final clean/synced workspace step.

## Phases

| # | Phase | What happens | Output file |
|---|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Research/Discovery | Facts only: requirement parsing → code-explorer maps affected code/patterns/tests/config → docs-lookup checks external docs when needed → completeness gate | `phase1-research.md` |
| 2 | Ideation | Strategy only: planner generates 2–3 grounded approaches → advisor gate → user selects | `phase2-ideation.md` |
| 3 | Plan | Blueprint only: code-architect turns selected approach into files, tasks, write sets, dependencies, parallel groups, and validation | `phase3-plan.md` |
| 4 | Execute | Per-task TDD loop: tdd-guide executes RED → GREEN → REFACTOR; main session reviews, validates, and checkpoints | `phase4-progress.md` |
| 5 | Review | code-reviewer always; security-reviewer conditional; review fixes delegated to tdd-guide/build-error-resolver | `phase5-review.md` |
| 6 | Finalize | Full validation with delegated repair if needed, documentation docking, closure decisions, issue/roadmap/archive updates, final commit and push | `phase6-summary.md` |

All phase files are written to `{project-root}/kaola-workflow/{project-name}/` while active. Completed workflow folders are archived to `{project-root}/kaola-workflow/archive/`. Active unfinished work is tracked in `{project-root}/kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md`.

## Resuming

Any interrupted session resumes from `workflow-state.md` first, then reconstructs from phase files if state is missing or stale. Phase 4 tracks `pending / in_progress / complete` per task in `phase4-progress.md`, and all phases record intra-phase checkpoints in `workflow-state.md`.

### State Bootstrap And Repair

When `/workflow-next` can reconstruct one safe next command from phase
artifacts, it repairs or creates `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`
before routing by running `scripts/kaola-workflow-repair-state.js` when the
helper is available. It does not create state for brand-new work, ambiguous
active projects, contradictory phase files, or unresolved compliance gates that
make the next command unsafe.

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, `hooks/hooks.json` injects a compact resume reminder after context compaction. Manual command install copies slash commands only; use plugin install when you want the compaction resume hook.

## Updating

```bash
cd Kaola-Workflow
